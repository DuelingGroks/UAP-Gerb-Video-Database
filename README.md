## üõ∏ About
**Disclaimer:** This project is not affiliated with Gerb's channel. I just enjoy Gerb's research and wanted to compile this as an open-source resource for all who may be interested.

**UAPGerbVideos** is an open-source project designed to assist dedicated UAP researchers by organizing and expanding on the investigations of **UAP Gerb**. The goal is to create a comprehensive **Obsidian database** hosted on GitHub, where researchers can collaborate through pull requests, refine transcripts, and enhance the collective understanding of UAP phenomena.

This project offers two main tools for researchers:
1. **Custom GPT Integration:** An AI trained on the curated data to provide detailed answers and analysis based on UAP Gerb‚Äôs research corpus.  
2. **Obsidian‚Äôs Graph View:** A powerful way to visualize connections between cases, whistleblower testimonies, government secrecy, and other UAP-related topics.

**Key Features:**
- **Hand-Checked Transcripts:** Transcripts are verified by both humans and AI to ensure accuracy and reliability.  
- **Collaborative Platform:** Researchers can propose changes, add new cases, and refine existing content.  
- **Comprehensive Scope:** Focuses on the **37 public videos** posted by UAP Gerb, covering incidents, reverse engineering claims, government secrecy, and more.

**Long-Term Vision:**
To evolve into a broader **open-source UAP/UFO investigation tool**, integrating data from other researchers and leveraging AI to uncover patterns and insights.

## üìå Project Overview
This repository serves as the **central database** for the UAP Gerb Video research project. The primary function of this repository is to be used with **Obsidian**, a markdown-based knowledge management tool, to organize and explore research on **Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs)**.

## üñ•Ô∏è Script Usage
The `UAPGerb_Repo_Manager.py` script automates the corpus generation AI files with the following tasks:
1. **Generates a comprehensive Word document** (`Full UAP Gerb Video Obsidian Corpus.docx`) with all `.md` files.
2. **Splits the `07 Gerbs UAP Video Analyses` folder** into five separate Word documents.
3. **Builds a folder tree view** (`folder_tree.txt`).

**To run the script:**

```bash
python UAPGerb_Repo_Manager.py
```
