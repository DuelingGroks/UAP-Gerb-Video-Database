What is the government trying to hide?

Book by [[Richard Sauder]], Ph.D.

"There are more underground bases than you think, and there's more going on than just planning to keep the President alive in a nuclear war"

"Working from government documents and corporate records, this book digs below the surface of the military's super-secret underground!"
