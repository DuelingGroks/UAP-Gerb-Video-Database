Initially called Project Saucer create by [[Nathan Twining|General Nathan Twining]].
## **üìå Overview**

**Project Sign** (1948‚Äì1949) was the **first official U.S. Air Force investigation into Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs)**, initiated in response to the post-World War II wave of flying disc sightings. Initially, Project Sign operated under the belief that UFOs could be **advanced foreign technology or even extraterrestrial in origin**. However, its final report was ultimately dismissed by high-ranking officials, leading to its replacement by **Project Grudge**.

For a brief period, **Project Sign was also unofficially referred to as "Project Saucer"**, though this name was mostly used in public-facing communications.

- **January 22, 1948** ‚Äì The **U.S. Air Force establishes Project Sign** following increased UFO reports, including **the 1947 [[Kenneth Arnold]] sighting** and the **[[1947 Roswell Crash|Roswell]] Incident**.
- **Late 1948** ‚Äì Some personnel within Sign believe certain UFOs may be **extraterrestrial** in origin.
- **October 1948** ‚Äì The "[[Estimate of the Situation]]" is drafted, concluding that some UFOs are **interplanetary craft**.
- **Late 1948** ‚Äì **USAF Chief of Staff [[Hoyt Vandenberg]] rejects the "[[Estimate of the Situation]]," ordering it to be destroyed**.
- **February 1949** ‚Äì **Project Sign is dissolved** and replaced by **[[Project Grudge]]**, which takes a more dismissive approach to UFOs.

## **üîç Key Findings & Approach**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Early Military Consideration of UFOs as Real Phenomena**

- Project Sign was **open to multiple hypotheses**, including **extraterrestrial origins**.
- Researchers compiled **credible pilot and military reports**, treating UFOs as potential **technological threats**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ "Estimate of the Situation" and Its Destruction**

- The **"Estimate of the Situation"** was a classified document concluding that some UFO sightings **defied conventional explanation and could be interplanetary.**
- **General Hoyt Vandenberg rejected the report**, arguing there was not enough solid evidence.
- This rejection effectively **ended the objective phase of UFO research** within the Air Force.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Key UFO Cases Investigated by Sign**

- **The [[1948 USA Gorman Dogfight]]** ‚Äì A U.S. Air Force pilot engaged a fast-moving UFO over Fargo, North Dakota.
- **The [[1948 Chiles-Whitted Sighting**]] ‚Äì Two commercial airline pilots witnessed a **cigar-shaped craft** with glowing windows pass near their aircraft.
- **The [[1948 Mantell Incident]]** ‚Äì A pilot chasing a UFO at high altitude lost consciousness and crashed; early explanations blamed a weather balloon.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Suppression and Transition to Project Grudge**

- Following the rejection of the "Estimate of the Situation," **Project Sign was ordered to shift focus away from extraterrestrial hypotheses**.
- Personnel advocating for serious UFO research were reassigned or ignored.
- The program was **shut down and rebranded as Project Grudge in early 1949**, marking a shift toward **debunking and psychological explanations** for UFO sightings.

## **üìú Project Sign‚Äôs Legacy**

- **First official government program to investigate UFOs.**
- **Generated one of the most controversial classified reports**‚Äîthe "Estimate of the Situation."
- **Paved the way for Project Blue Book**, despite later efforts to dismiss UFO research.
- **Contributed to the UFO secrecy culture** within the U.S. military.

## **üîó Cross-References**

- **[[Project Grudge]]** ‚Äì The immediate successor to Sign, tasked with debunking UFO sightings.
- **[[Project Blue Book]]** ‚Äì The long-running government UFO study from 1952 to 1969.
- **[[Gorman Dogfight]]** ‚Äì A famous case investigated under Project Sign.
- **[[Condon Committee]]** ‚Äì The 1968 study that ultimately ended public UFO investigations.
- **[[Estimate of the Situation]]** ‚Äì The lost classified document concluding UFOs may be interplanetary.

## **‚ùì Open Questions**

1. **What specific evidence led Project Sign personnel to consider an interplanetary hypothesis?**
2. **Why was "The Estimate of the Situation" destroyed instead of preserved for further analysis?**
3. **Did high-ranking officials already suspect something classified about UFOs, leading to Sign‚Äôs shutdown?**

## **Conclusion**

Project Sign represents the **brief window where the U.S. government seriously considered UFOs as a legitimate scientific and military concern**. However, with the destruction of the "Estimate of the Situation" and the transition to Project Grudge, the military‚Äôs stance **shifted toward debunking rather than investigating**‚Äîa stance that shaped UFO research policy for decades to come.
