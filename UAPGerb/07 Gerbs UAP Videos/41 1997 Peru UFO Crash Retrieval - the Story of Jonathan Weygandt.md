# Transcript:

00:00:00:00 - 00:00:26:06
[[Jonathan Waygandt]]: It was. It was weird. It was bluish green color. And you could tell it was like. It was just weird. Anyway, it's hard to explain. It kind of like like like it was like. It seemed just like, be along. I mean, it was almost like if you were looking like something organic, then, I don't know, I couldn't tell, didn't look like anything.

00:00:26:06 - 00:00:53:01
[[Jonathan Waygandt]]: We would make, like machine parts or anything look like it was spoke. And these were these large vents. They look like they went into the craft and I couldn't, I couldn't tell, but it I mean, there was a shadow that was the only thing that really cast a shadow. The rest of this was another thing was these vents cast the shadow where you could see where there was a light, but the sun was shining right on the object, and it didn't cast a shadow, not on anything.

00:00:53:02 - 00:01:12:03
[[Jonathan Waygandt]]: It was like, kind of like absorbing the light. It was weird. Strange. There was no reflection or anything like that, you know. Is there anything positive at all that you've got now? Yeah, I'm still a lot. Yeah, yeah. They threw me into the mud and all that liquid. Got my hair in my face. Oh, yeah. They were like scientists.

00:01:12:03 - 00:01:41:16
[[Jonathan Waygandt]]: I suppose they had, this type of, like, we call it mop gear, right? Mission oriented, protective posture. And, they had gas masks on and, like, rubber suits and, they were they were coming around, and you had all kinds of weird people there. Some had some version of mop or personal protective posture on and personal protective gear and, and it was all different ones, different kinds.

00:01:41:18 - 00:02:26:03

Very few firsthand UFO witness encounters over the decades have matched the intrigue, coherence and respect as former US marine Lance Corporal Jonathan Wigand, Lance Corporal Wigand first told of his harrowing UFO crash retrieval encounter during official service in U.S Operation Laser Strike in the Peruvian jungle through Steven Greer in the year 2000, as a young perimeter security marine tasked to investigate a downed aircraft thought to be a South American drug smuggling plane or friendly U.S vehicle, the Lance corporal claimed to have stumbled upon a crashed egg shaped UFO and subsequent Department of Energy Retrieval team that, in my opinion, gives us one of the greatest possible instances of insight into how U.S government rapid reaction

00:02:26:03 - 00:02:58:18
Unknown
UFO recovery teams operate. Since his original testimony, vacant has publicly discussed his encounter with a non-human craft, an antagonistic D.o.e. retrieval team, only once more in 2023, Jonathan Wiggins appeared on a podcast with Martin Willis re addressing aspects of the Lance corporals incredible encounter, but exploring little new ground. Today I am beyond excited to announce a true successor to Jonathan Wiggins 2000 testimony, an in-person discussion where Jonathan and myself discuss why he went public.

00:02:58:19 - 00:03:21:20
Unknown
New details of the UFO crash retrieval encounter, adverse health effects and reprisals Jonathan has faced, and so much more. Before this discussion, I thought it pertinent to take a step back and cover Wiggins testimony in painstaking details. After all, I have covered this case before and one of my first ever projects, but barely even scratched the surface of this encounter.

00:03:22:01 - 00:03:46:01
Unknown
So before I sit down with Wiggins in the coming weeks, let's take a step back and analyze every single detail of this 1997 encounter. From piecing together the origins and deployment of the D.o.e. recovery Team to contacting other Marines allegedly involved with the case, to determining where Wiggins may have been taken and interrogated, to analyzing specific, similar egg shaped UFO crash retrievals.

00:03:46:01 - 00:04:11:20
Unknown
Let us leave no stone unturned. Analyzing one of the most fascinating firsthand UFO crash retrieval cases in history. Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and I am thrilled for you to join me today as we embark on a comprehensive analysis of the claims of Lance Corporal Jonathan Wiggins. As a precursor to my in-person interview with Jonathan, I thought it pertinent to step back and critically analyze the entirety of his testimony.

00:04:11:20 - 00:04:40:13
Unknown
This investigation will not seek to simply retell this incredible UFO crash case, but to unravel this case and gain insights into U.S. UFO crash retrieval teams. And before we get started, a few things to point out. I would like to thank Robert UFOs and take home for their incredible 2023 work into Wiggins case. These excellent researchers arrived at many of the same conclusions I did long before this project, so please check out their work in the video description.

00:04:40:15 - 00:05:04:06
Unknown
I'll also be pulling clips from Wiggins 2023 podcast with Martin Willis in 2000. Tape testimony with Steven Greer, and it is worthy to note Greer chopped up Wiggins original testimony, omitting certain details. These include Wiggins describing what looked to be a four fingered arm hanging out of a recessed hall in the crashed UFO. Greer seemingly omitted this from the 2000 testimony.

00:05:04:09 - 00:05:24:00
Unknown
Due to this, I will be pulling Wiggins recorded tapes off of Stephen Greer's DPI archive to try and capture Wiggins words uncut and in their purest form, but these files are still chopped up and edited. I have found it impossible to get my hands on the full, unedited tape, but this is the closest we can get due to these rough files.

00:05:24:00 - 00:05:49:01
Unknown
Audio quality is significantly worse than the published interview, but I still find it important to publish Wiggins words without edits. These source files contain many additional details. Time spent with Wiggins military records and drawings, as well as questions asked by filmmaker James Fox that were curiously cut out of the 2000 published interview. This one was the one that was half open and you could see into it, but I mean, it was just black.

00:05:49:01 - 00:06:24:11
Unknown
It was like looking into a closet. Where were you standing alongside the 2000 tape? I have found, and will be often referencing Jonathan's outreach to Greer's team from August 2000, just two months before his taped testimony. And of course, it goes without saying. I will often be pulling my own clips from my time spent with Jonathan. And with all that being said, let's start our investigation and first travel back all the way to 1997 to relive the experience of Lance Corporal Wigand.

00:06:24:13 - 00:06:51:14
Unknown
And basically, I was there, and then I was transferred over to the section for the laser strike in February of 97, as a young man, Jonathan Gant joined the Marine Corps in 1995 and served until 1998. After a back injury suffered in training, Jonathan Service led him to the second Low Altitude Air Defense Battalion within the Marine Corps Air Control Group 28, stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point.

00:06:51:20 - 00:07:20:20
Unknown
During this time, where Gant served as a low altitude air defense gunner with training on Stinger man portable air defense systems, MANPADs and Avenger surface to air missile Sam platforms. In 1997 was Gant in the USMC Mach G 28 were deployed to Boot camp of Peru to support Operation Laser Strike, specifically to operate as perimeter security for mission radar installations and to replace aging Hawk missile batteries with Stinger and Avenger missile platforms.

00:07:20:22 - 00:07:53:19
Unknown
Laser strike was one of numerous U.S. worldwide classified operations under U.S. South Com, or U.S. Southern Command to counter narcotics traffic in Peru. The operation included up to 20 U.S. agencies, including the USMC Drug Enforcement Agency, Air Force, CIA, National Guard, and U.S. Army Special Forces, as well as local Peruvian forces such as Peruvian Air Force or FHP laser strike served to conduct three phases of counter drug operations, including illegal use of airspace, alternate transportation modes, and production capabilities.

00:07:54:00 - 00:08:21:08
Unknown
Laser strike employed several acknowledged data acquisition and radar systems to accomplish its mission, including TPS 43 and relocatable over the Horizon radar systems, or rather and possibly covertly utilized satellites from the Defense Support Program. In 1996, laser Strike preceded Operation Green Clover, a similar U.S. operation to combat narcotics transfer in Peru and Colombia, but much smaller in scale.

00:08:21:12 - 00:08:49:02
Unknown
In the 12 month period from April 1996 to April 97th. Within the timeline of Jonathan's encounter, air and ground base radar used by laser strike tracked 45,000. Total aircraft, 5390 of these were quote unquote, tracks of interest. Only 150 of these were suspected of drug trafficking, but only 21 such planes were forced or shot down. However, the exact number of shoot downs was classified.

00:08:49:04 - 00:09:15:00
Unknown
Three primary locations satisfied. This mission, conducted in Peru, put copper on those in Iquitos, whose mission was to track, identify, and ground by warning or force drug trafficking aircraft entering or leaving Peruvian airspace in support of laser strike in counter drug operations. U.S. Special Forces were additionally sent to Iquitos, Peru, to the more violent Riverine Training Team to train with Peruvian military forces.

00:09:15:05 - 00:09:37:16
Unknown
US South Column authorized up to 14 special forces deployments to the region during 1997, and one major special forces group that aided in South American counter drug operations. Attached to US South Comm was the U.S. Army's seventh Special Forces Group, aka the U.S. Army Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Historically, the seventh Special Forces out of so.

00:09:37:16 - 00:10:03:18
Unknown
Com or Special Operations Command within the first Special Forces Command had previously been deployed in Operation Snow Cap, a Drug Enforcement Agency counter-narcotics operation in nine Latin American countries alongside the US Navy Seals, the Army's seventh Special Forces Group has conducted foreign internal defense, counter drug and training missions in Central and South America. The seventh specializes in unconventional warfare and direct action.

00:10:03:18 - 00:10:43:00
Unknown
Special reconnaissance, counter proliferation of WMD or warheads of mass destruction, and security force assistance. While this discussion of Green Berets and Special Operations Command units attached to laser strike recall how quite often I discussed the involvement of Special Operations Command or their Elite component Command Jayhawk Joint Special Operations Command in UFO crash retrieval operations. Well, this will all become apparent quite soon when discussing Wigan's retrieval encounter up to his involvement in laser strike, Jonathan had no interest in the subject of UFOs, but his worldview was somewhat shaken during his guard station performing perimeter security at his laser strike radar installation.

00:10:43:00 - 00:11:09:06
Unknown
We can't would state in the command center of the radar installation. He would overhear USAF personnel discussing aircraft tracked flying in and out of the atmosphere at mock ten plus. I knew these these aircraft were flying because I had been in the command center there at the radar installation things, and I heard on a couple women there in the air Force talking about aircraft flying in and out of the atmosphere locked in place.

00:11:09:07 - 00:11:27:03
Unknown
So these aircraft were flying around and, you know, they're, you know, they're reenter the atmosphere or whatever. And they were talked about, we got these aircraft flying again. And the other girls. Yeah. You know, they're coming in and out of the atmosphere and there's our stuffing is so there's our aircraft and they're like, you know I can't remember what she said.

00:11:27:05 - 00:11:54:07
Unknown
We get what even stayed in the Air Force. Colonel would enter the command center about 30 minutes after this conversation and confiscate logbooks tracking flight data. I I'm not sure, but I think these logs did contain those tracks. Otherwise they would they were talking and we're talking about, you know, there's hundreds, thousands of aircraft flying through the air, you know, weekly and all these logs, you know, they're right about and, you know, there keep you there.

00:11:54:07 - 00:12:13:14
Unknown
Right. And you know how many times through your crafter they can they get certain vectors for aircraft that are supposed to be around. I mean, when you got when you get objects that are reentering the atmosphere, then stopping on a dime and then turning around and going exactly the opposite direction, it's kind of strange. Meteors don't do that.

00:12:13:16 - 00:12:32:17
Unknown
Oh, is it something that was rare or something that was happening? All this is happening all the time. There's like 3 or 4 incidents where I was duty there that the same, the same Air Force officer came in there to get books. And do you think these were tracked on radar? Yeah, that these were tracked from this particular radar that were logged in.

00:12:32:19 - 00:13:08:09
Unknown
The reason, I guess the reason they were taking them is they didn't want people to know that they're tracking these aircraft, I guess. I mean, yeah, this I'm just one night while on guard duty at around 11 p.m. to midnight between April and March 1997, Wigand was approached by Staff Sergeant Monta Lee gray, Sergeant Allen, and Sergeant Adkins and told that there was a downed aircraft, possibly friendly, and that he and other Marines were needed to secure the crash site by 3 to 4 a.m., Jonathan, Adkins and Allen were in the vanguard of a group of Humvees among 8 to 10 Marines sent to secure the crash area.

00:13:08:11 - 00:13:19:12
Unknown
After a combination of driving and trekking through the jungle, the Marines reached the site around 6 to 7 a.m..

00:13:19:14 - 00:13:42:19
Unknown
And, they they came to us and said, look, you know, we got we got a situation where we have an aircraft crash that's possibly friendly, and they need us to go and secure the crash site. And we're like, fine, say it. This is a real this is late at night and about 11 or 12 at night. And I was on guard duty that night, so I was already up and it was my shift.

00:13:42:19 - 00:14:03:16
Unknown
We have a 12 hour shift, 12 on, 12 off. And where we where we rotate the our section. So we all went out that night. We got up all day, 3 or 4 in the morning and headed out in Humvees. We had about 5 or 6 Hummers and we drove to where we needed to go. And then from there, you know, we had to hunt through the bush.

00:14:03:18 - 00:14:29:07
Unknown
So we got there, I don't know, six, seven, just just one day I had just started to get like and, well, we found the area really easy because there was a, there was a huge gash in the land where, where something had crashed and that it it didn't break anything, you know, you know, I don't know if you've ever been to a crash site where, you know, you had, you know, trees, you know, just broken like, like and half everything was burned.

00:14:29:07 - 00:14:47:22
Unknown
And it was like, like if you had almost cut like a warm butter with a knife. I mean, it was just it's like it's it's like something on fire or had or some kind of energy, like a laser almost had like gutted. I mean, it was really strange. And anyway, I was, I was in the front with Sarge now and sorry, Atkins.

00:14:47:22 - 00:15:14:07
Unknown
So we were up front and we were, we were pointing basically and we were like, I don't know, ten 20m ahead of everyone else. We had. We all had maps and radios and compasses, so we knew so we wouldn't get lost. And basically we were the first ones to see the object. And basically what happened is we didn't go straight up the hill because basically this thing went up the hill and then off into the side of the ravine and the ridge.

00:15:14:07 - 00:15:33:03
Unknown
This is about a 200ft ridge, at least solid granite. I mean, it's rock. I don't know if it's granites. It was buried in a sort of cliff. But anyway, we didn't go straight up. We went to the, to the to on to the left and walked up to the top of the ridge. That's when we saw the craft.

00:15:33:05 - 00:15:56:06
Unknown
But I mean, it had landed and cut its way through the jungle and embed itself. And like us, I don't know what you would call it, almost like a saddle. One of these kind of foothills. It's kind of a ridge and one of the side of what? And I can't remember how far from the initial impact that when it landed, it actually physically hit the deck and then went in.

00:15:56:08 - 00:16:19:06
Unknown
I don't know how far down it was. Yeah. Yeah, man. It burned itself like into the deck, you know, like a foot or two. I don't know, it was the the terrified and confused Marines climbed down the ridge to get closer to this object with it getting the closest of all the Marines wagon, Allen and Adkins observed a huge ship embedded at a 45 degree angle into the rocky cliff face.

00:16:19:08 - 00:16:44:05
Unknown
This is the craft. This is pretty crude, two dimensional drawing, but this is jungle here. This is the craft. And it was embedded, in the in the rock like this. And, I'm not sure if this tapered off or how it went, but, these right here are the hatches, these two objects here. This one was the one that was half open and you could see into it, but, I mean, it was just black.

00:16:44:05 - 00:17:12:17
Unknown
It was like looking into a closet. Where were you standing? Damage. I think for the missile. And these were these large vents. They look like they went into the craft, but I couldn't tell. But, I mean, it was a shadow. That was the only thing that really cast a shadow. The rest of this, well, was another thing was these vents cast to the shadow, where you could see where there was a light, but the sun was shining right on the object, and it didn't cast a shadow, not on anything.

00:17:12:18 - 00:17:42:08
Unknown
It was like kind of like absorbing the light. It was weird. Strange. There was no reflection or anything like that. The object was a massive metallic egg or teardrop shape, measuring ten meters in height and 20m in length. Probably like 3 or 4 standard 53ft trailers wide and about three light, like one two, three four, one two, three, four.

00:17:42:10 - 00:18:07:22
Unknown
So about 16 of those together. So it was pretty big, man. It was catastrophic damage likely leading to the crash of the vehicle was visible. No debris littered the area, but we again observed an enormous gash in the rear of the craft. Jonathan guessed this damage to be from Hawkman 23 missile batteries. Although Hawk systems were phased out of military use in 1994, the USMC maintained usage until 2002.

00:18:07:22 - 00:18:31:08
Unknown
However, widget gas, the Hawk system used to down the craft was used by the Peruvian Air Force, this being because the USMC phased out Hawk missiles from laser strike in early 1997, though he has no direct knowledge to this day. Wiegand, after extensive studying of MIM 23 ballistics, believes Hawk fragmentation and missiles caused the damage in downing of the craft.

00:18:31:10 - 00:19:00:18
Unknown
Yeah, well, what I think happened, I think a lot of that fragmentation like went into the craft and like bounced around right after it got hit and as it was going down. So, you know, probably didn't come out. But like I said, if the missile it hit it depending on, you know, what the craft was made of and depending on the speed of the missile and its angle and all that, I think it I think it probably would have penetrated and exploded and it would have just disintegrated the ship too.

00:19:00:20 - 00:19:32:17
Unknown
This then presents a unique question how could a conventional missile down a highly advanced non-human craft, similar intriguing incidents like a quote unquote, 1 in 1,000,000 targeting of a teardrop shaped UFO by a naval destroyer in 1973 was discussed in my last project on naval legacy programs, MIM 23 Hawk missiles are unique. Hawks are not only able to utilize conventional missiles, but also airburst rounds which exploded near not on a target to damage enemy personnel or vehicles with devastating fragmentation.

00:19:32:17 - 00:19:56:04
Unknown
Perhaps a conventional missile can never hit a moving UFO, but perhaps in this case a Hawk. MIM 23 got just close enough to frag and down a target. But let's get back to the wreckage. The best way we could describe the craft was metallic, but organic, almost as if it was alive. The object did not appear as if it was made of machine parts, but more sculpted.

00:19:56:06 - 00:20:35:09
Unknown
The craft was purplish green and fluctuating in color, almost like gasoline on water. This effect is known as the mother of pearl effect, and the changing colors would sometimes even make the craft near translucent. Well, I thought at one point it looked half light green and half purple, and then it was kind of it was it was changing the image of the not not the physical properties of it, how it was, was constructed or whatever, but that there was some kind of field on it and it was going like I said, we Greer it was like, you know, when you wash your car would, you know, fluid, right, with a light palm oil or

00:20:35:09 - 00:20:58:15
Unknown
whatever, dish detergent. And when it bubbles up, it gives, like the, the color chemical rainbow. It was like that, but all over the craft. And it was kind of like, moving around. Weird. I can't, so it wasn't just. No, no, it was it was kind of like moving around and going. Sometimes it would go like, completely like, almost like silver.

00:20:58:15 - 00:21:19:08
Unknown
Like the disabled craft was dripping a liquid with the viscosity of sirup. This liquid had poured all over the surrounding foliage that hatch that was a jar of busted open, broke open. That's where the liquid seemed to come from. Right. And it seemed to come out of there, and it was everywhere. Man, could you describe before it was clear?

00:21:19:08 - 00:21:41:15
Unknown
Well, no, the the the, whatever that stuff was, I don't know what to call it. The fluid, it was clear, like just, you know, water. Water clear. The fluid was clear. Yeah, but it was viscous, like. Yeah, but it was thick, like maple sirup. A large sweeping light traveled around the circumference of the vehicle. That slowed until the vehicle seemingly powered off.

00:21:41:18 - 00:22:08:11
Unknown
Along with this sweeping light, Wiggin could hear the craft dimming until it went silent. We can't describe the sound as a guitar amplifier. There was, there was warm light on it that slowly went around and in the machine. I could hear it. I could hear, I guess, because it was still functioning and it had like a like a hum to it, like like a really bass, like, say, if you unplugged an amp from a guitar, that kind of, you know, it was real.

00:22:08:11 - 00:22:28:15
Unknown
It really, you know, it was really deep, but it was wow. It was loud, man. It was like a deep, like a like, you know, rap. It would be. It would have been like several orders of magnitude louder than, you know, the real deep bass rap boom, boom, boom, right? It was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, like this.

00:22:28:15 - 00:22:46:17
Unknown
But it was more like a I don't know, man. I just can't describe it. It's not even like that. I mean, it's just undescribable. It was that light. It's almost sounded like a chemical sound, man. Like a chemical, like water. Kind of like sound when you're. It's weird. And that light was slowing down, right? Yeah. It finally stopped, right?

00:22:46:17 - 00:23:16:06
Unknown
Everything was shut off. This sound of a guitar amp is almost identical to the testimony of former Marine Michael Herrera, who described the same sound emanating from an eight gone alien reproduction vehicle. As Jonathan got closer to the craft, he was able to make up more surface detail, such as the craft not being smooth, but featuring what looked to be notches and bumps 50 to 100 yards away from the craft, Jonathan got the mysterious liquid all over what Marines call kameez or battle dress uniform.

00:23:16:11 - 00:23:38:08
Unknown
The liquid discolored his kameez like acid in eight Jonathan skin. So you got within like 150 to 300ft of this, right? This thing was so high up on the cliff face. You got some of this liquid on? Yeah. Yeah, it was everywhere. And what did it do to you? What did it do to your clothes? Well, I mean, they took my clothes, but my base, my hair on my legs went away and it's never really come back.

00:23:38:10 - 00:24:02:11
Unknown
I lost all my hair on my my, on my legs. Determine. And yet frightened. The young lance corporal maintained his gaze on this incredible ship. The crashed vehicle additionally featured large vents on the free standing side, where Gant described similar to fish gills. Though he could only see one side of the craft Jonathan wagered. The same gills he guessed were used for propulsion were featured on the other side of the craft.

00:24:02:13 - 00:24:25:19
Unknown
Yeah, on the part of it look like I don't know what it was, but yeah, it had sort of like these, under a really tight kind of like ellipse that ran down the side, like got small got or got progressively smaller. And, and I only saw like a couple of freaking times because it was so weird. I don't know what it was.

00:24:25:20 - 00:24:47:08
Unknown
The, all I could say, it was like some type of force field. I don't know what it was. Three seemingly non flush hatches sat near the top of the craft. One of these hatches being half open although no lights were visible from behind the hatch. Wignot did observe what appeared to be a four fingered arm hanging limply from the open hatch.

00:24:47:11 - 00:25:07:13
Unknown
This element of Wiggins testimony was seemingly cut from his 2000 interview with Wigand, confirming to me that it must have indeed been cut as he did inform Greer of this arm. Yeah. What one of the creatures was. His arm and hand was hanging out of him. He was hanging out. Did it come up? Was it hanging out when you walked up to it?

00:25:07:13 - 00:25:23:23
Unknown
It was. Yeah, he was hanging out of it. Probably dying. I don't know about the other pilot. I don't know what they were, to be honest with you, but I guess you could call them aliens or whatever. I guess that would be. Yeah. Yeah, right. And then, one of them was, I think he was dying almost or close to death.

00:25:23:23 - 00:25:49:11
Unknown
Right. Crash. But I like I said, this is real. This is what I thought at the time. I mean, I don't know, this detail is very interesting as I am reminded of the 1965 kecksburg Pennsylvania crash retrieval encounter where multiple eyewitnesses described biologics inside the bell shaped craft whose appendages were visible once a craft hatch had opened and the vehicle was depressurized.

00:25:49:13 - 00:26:10:22
Unknown
So you and two sergeants who led the Vanguard got the closest to the craft. But you got the closest, right? I was the closest to it, and the other two sergeants were kind of standing a little bit off while you got up. And as I ran up to it, was there anything weird about your guys's compasses, comms? They all of that was all, you know, it wasn't working, so your compass was just going haywire?

00:26:10:22 - 00:26:31:20
Unknown
Yeah, it was spinning around around the same time, Jonathan felt like a presence was reaching out to contact him. You got a clear sense that there were some kind of lifeforms. Yes, it was lifeforms. And the ship I and I could they were. It's almost like if someone was, like, reading your mind and that's the way it felt.

00:26:31:22 - 00:26:53:08
Unknown
I felt like I saw the presence. It's like supernatural, you know what? I felt this presence, but it's real strange. I guess it was almost like, I think the Kree. I told Leslie as I thought the creatures would they call me. And it was like, weird. They were. I think they were trying to communicate with me, like, I guess telepathically.

00:26:53:08 - 00:27:19:02
Unknown
It's really weird not believing in any of that stuff. But anyway, it was I could I could hear like it was terrible because it kept going and then it still comes and goes. It's like basically sitting in your car internal, like an Am station. That's not, you know, it's just white noise and it's turning up really hard. And that's what I heard when I, when I first got in there, I didn't ask any of the other guys when I heard that or anything.

00:27:19:04 - 00:27:41:10
Unknown
Jonathan was mesmerized by this presence. He felt the creatures were informing him that everything would be all right, but we're also requesting his help. He was so spellbound, he ignored the cries and cutscenes of Sergeants Allen and Adkins, who stood away from the craft, shouting that way not to get any closer. They were. They were scared. And it was the apprehension, the fear.

00:27:41:10 - 00:28:11:11
Unknown
And then they they were not here to harm. And that's really what what it felt like. And I mean, that's not that's not my own emotions. That was something that they were projecting towards me. Like if somebody was shallow like I'm spotlighted. And that's why I felt they were directing their thoughts at me. I mean, this is not I mean, I didn't think about all this at the time, but it's been because I've seen the creatures in like in my thoughts, you know, I've seen I've, I saw them and what they look like.

00:28:11:13 - 00:28:34:18
Unknown
And they projected that I didn't I didn't tell week on until Leslie, the senior year. I was it was like, you know, it was the Grays basically. And and I'm not just saying that, but I never really was into the UFO stuff. And I didn't read books on when I was a kid, but basically the oh, the, the, the oval egg head with big dark eyes, big eyes, nose and small mouth.

00:28:34:18 - 00:28:52:19
Unknown
There was, I think I've had, you know, dreams of them, you know, so, but I didn't see them, but they were not a small, you know, a small car, like three or 4 or 5. Right? They were huge. And you said these were tall, like. Yeah, they were huge. What what were their heads like? Like classic.

00:28:52:19 - 00:29:13:17
Unknown
Yeah. Classic. But really like elongated towered coming up like this. And they'd have been a probably this big like a balloon. Yeah. No. Like the kind of like the more oblong shape. Not like the classic if you look at communion. Right. Whitley. Streeter. Right. But the artwork they have on there, they would not have been fat like that.

00:29:13:17 - 00:29:33:00
Unknown
They were more or skinnier. But they're also like on a kind of a skinny heart. And they were projecting that they weren't here. They were curved, they were here and they were, you know, that they were not going to harm me. And that was basically that everything was going to be all right. Just help me. This helps get out here.

00:29:33:02 - 00:29:52:22
Unknown
I think they were I don't I don't know how many were on the craft. You haven't seen more than one. Yeah, definitely more than one. Probably by 4 or 5. I don't know. Just that's not me. Not a large number. The communication from the occupants of the craft, as well as the appearance of the craft, led Jonathan to believe this vehicle was controlled via thoughts.

00:29:53:03 - 00:30:21:22
Unknown
With the massive discussion of psionics here in 2025, to the testimony of Jake Barber and skywatchers, this early mention of basically psionics in 2000, by way Gant is extremely interesting. Additionally, I have discussed before dating all the way back to the 1950s stories and testimonies of UFOs being controlled with consciousness, headband transceivers, or unique control mechanisms. To learn more about this subject, I do recommend checking out my video on the claims of Colonel Philip J.

00:30:21:22 - 00:30:48:14
Unknown
Corso. After about 15 to 20 minutes at the site, Wiggin and the other Marines embarked to climb back up the ridge to rendezvous with the rest of the Mack G 28 Marines when they were greeted by 2 to 4 Army 47 helicopters flying overhead, preparing to land in a nearby clearing. When Jonathan and the others climbed to the top of the gorge, the Marines were quickly intercepted by armed men dressed in black fatigues, styled similarly to a Swat team.

00:30:48:17 - 00:31:09:16
Unknown
It was almost like they were there already. They were on the ground already and and whoever was flying over was coming in after the these guys had landed. So I'm and I'm not sure where they, they landed, where they were, but they were just there on top of the site within a few minutes. And so it's I can't remember exactly how it's speculation on your part.

00:31:09:16 - 00:31:24:16
Unknown
You don't know for sure, but you think it's possible that he may have been there first? Yeah. They all they were definitely there first and they were monitoring us to I'm sure they knew we were in the area when we got up there near. But they looked army but they didn't have, you know, insignia on them. Right. They were the same color.

00:31:24:16 - 00:31:49:00
Unknown
And all of these men spoke with American dialects but bore no insignia, patches or identification. The men were older, in their late 30s and 40s, and immediately showed signs of extreme hostility and aggression. Black midis, right with what was the army would call bodies like our camp is right there, like our our, fatigues, but they would have been totally black, totally black shirt.

00:31:49:06 - 00:32:13:10
Unknown
And they had helmets on. The guys at wrong, I didn't know they had, this, they had boonie caps and they had the soft, army covers around Army Hill. You remember what kind of weapons they had? Was it actually had I think they had mp3's and and Glocks and shotguns. Okay. So I think maybe there was a few M16s.

00:32:13:10 - 00:32:28:06
Unknown
I mean, this has been a long time. They had many guns on the, on the, on the 47. So the 80s actually had they had many guns on the side. Did they have a man at the gun? Yeah, they had a man and he was wearing, like the skull type, a freaking helmet, man. It's like a really wicked.

00:32:28:07 - 00:32:48:00
Unknown
Yeah. It looked satanic. Yeah. So when, when this team encountered you guys, did they have their weapons trained at you? Not at gunpoint. Oh, yeah. And so they immediately start. Do they strip you guys of gear? What do they rough? Yeah. No, they were we were setting our gear up and taking them out and throwing it out and empty in our pockets and everything.

00:32:48:05 - 00:33:08:07
Unknown
Later in our investigation, we will devote a significant amount of time to attempt to track down the origin of this team. So sit tight for a little bit. Having the jump on the Marines, the unknown operators stripped vacant Allen and Adkins of their gear and weapons. The young Lance corporal took a swing at one of the men, cracking him on his head for his transgressions.

00:33:08:07 - 00:33:36:18
Unknown
Jonathan was beaten, restrained and forced to lie down, face down on the jungle floor, getting even more of the strange liquid on him. During this scuffle, a team of near 30 began departing. The landed 47 helicopters. This team featured individuals in rain jackets bearing three letters Delta, Oscar, echo. Oh, then they were like scientists. I suppose it, this type of, like, we call it mob gear, right?

00:33:36:18 - 00:34:17:05
Unknown
Mission oriented, protective posture. And, they had gas masks on and, like, rubber suits and, they were they were coming around and you had all kinds of weird people there. Some had some version of mob or personal protective posture on and personal protective gear and, and it was all different ones, different times. D.o.e. is, of course, the acronym for the infamous Department of Energy, the successor to the Atomic Energy Commission, whose 1954 Atomic Energy Act historically served as a monolith to misclassify UFO materials and data as quote unquote trans classified foreign nuclear information.

00:34:17:07 - 00:34:43:09
Unknown
Is there any indication that the Department of Energy is involved in UAP data collection and housing? I don't have an answer. I can't confirm or deny that in a public setting. And could you do it in a in a secure setting? Yes. The d.o.e. really needs no introduction. Whether it's my work, the reporting of Chris Sharp or the words of David Grush, the d.o.e. is almost always mentioned as a primary pillar of UFO legacy program operations.

00:34:43:13 - 00:35:09:11
Unknown
Key in my work are the numerous implications of the Doe's FFR, DCS, or federally funded research and development centers such as the Lawrence Livermore National Labs, Los Alamos National Labs, Sandia National Labs, and Doe contractors such as Triad National Security, one third of which is run by Battelle Memorial Institute's direct involvement in technologies of unknown origin exploitation programs, and similar to the seasoned operator.

00:35:09:11 - 00:35:37:00
Unknown
Soon in this video, we will attempt to track down exactly what this Doe team was, where they were stationed, and more. In addition to the people in Department of Energy, rain jackets, the team featured members dressed in biological containment suits donned with Doe lettering. We can't describe these as similar to spacesuits. It wasn't like that. It was more high tech, like there's big jumpsuits that you zip up the back and you can, like, we're breathing apparatus in there.

00:35:37:02 - 00:36:14:10
Unknown
There's guys, there's about 30 of them at least. And they marched right by me as I was. I was being taken away. They were marching to get down on the cliff. I guess they were in there to check this thing out. These suits mentioned remind me closely of myriad crash retrieval team testimonies I have covered in the past, and I'm immediately reminded of eyewitness accounts to the 1965 Kecksburg Pennsylvania UFO crash, where witnesses claimed that men in quote unquote, moon suits carried boxes and equipment into the crash site a little while later, there was a large truck pulled in a light colored truck box van type out of it.

00:36:14:10 - 00:36:48:01
Unknown
There was four guys come up. They had what we call moon suits. At the time. They were white coverall type suit. They took a box out of their box, maybe 4 or 5ft square. They carry them four handles and they carried that down to the object. But just right after that, there was a military man. After being restrained and beaten by the operators, Jonathan was stripped of his underwear by the men in containment suits before having his feet bound, and was handcuffed to a stretcher.

00:36:48:07 - 00:37:08:12
Unknown
Did the other two sergeants have any liquid on them? No, not that I remember. I'm the only one I think got hit with all that because they were they did not go up under the the craft and in the very close immediate vicinity of at this time where was separated from Allen and Adkins and taken aboard one of the team's helicopters.

00:37:08:14 - 00:37:26:02
Unknown
No, no. They said that, you know, the I was they were constantly seeing and I was a why don't you why don't you people ever, you know, pay attention to orders. You weren't supposed to be there. And you're not supposed to see this thing. You know, you're you're going to be dangerous if we let you go with all this stuff.

00:37:26:02 - 00:37:49:14
Unknown
Yeah. I mean, I thought I thought they were going to kill me. Really? I'm finally, I'm fairly sure we get was flown to a base different than his deployment site. This location featured significantly more permanent structures than his radar site. And Jonathan guessed this was partially a Peruvian military installation. Curiously, here we again observe not just Americans on site, but many nationalities.

00:37:49:16 - 00:38:08:07
Unknown
There's a lot of other nationalities, you know, Chinese, Germans, I think, were there. I mean, a lot of the people working at this other base. But, I mean, this thing was really I mean, I didn't go in and all they did was take me to like a, like a you couldn't go out. So it was more of like a, it was more like an interrogation room.

00:38:08:07 - 00:38:27:16
Unknown
And I said, no more for only 15 hours. Yeah, there were merch, man. That was the other thing, because, yeah, there's a lot of those dudes that in the China, and there was two Chinese dudes there that I remember. They spent very well English, but they were in the German. The Germans, but they were military fatigues. Yeah, same.

00:38:27:16 - 00:38:47:19
Unknown
But what do they have? Weapons. Yeah, pistols. I would assume that they were Glocks, but I didn't. I couldn't see them because they're they're the standard U.S. pistol light and it covers it up. They were holstered on the head. Yeah. Right. So this these guys by their black helmets may have been from the same team. Yeah. I was looking at a and they yelled at me.

00:38:47:19 - 00:39:07:09
Unknown
No not for me not to look at. Look at them. Wow. I didn't think they wanted me to remember them. That's what they. When they did the from what you could see. What were they doing. Were they just kind of at General Station? Yeah. Just whatever they were doing I don't know what they were doing. Whatever. I have a strong thesis of where this location might be and we will discuss this soon.

00:39:07:09 - 00:39:32:22
Unknown
Wigan was not taken into a cell or forced into isolated barracks, but was instead taken underground and sequestered in an interrogation room, where he was contained for up to two days. During this hellacious day, Jonathan was interrogated and tormented by one of the operators who detained him. And I couldn't really readily identify these guys, but I knew, I knew that, I knew one of them was at the crash site.

00:39:32:22 - 00:39:56:10
Unknown
They were one of the guys that I recognized because he was in Black Steve. He was like, what you see? And he's like, where's the ground? You know, you guys, are you a patriot? You like the Constitution? I'm like, yeah. He's like, well, we don't we don't, you know, we're on our own program. You know, we don't. We just do warnings like, you know, and they're like, they're growling and they're rushing you and they're yelling at me in the hollering, cursing.

00:39:56:12 - 00:40:14:08
Unknown
You didn't see anything, you know? And we'll do you and your whole family there. You know, it was it was basically that for about 8 or 9 hours, I mean, they took breaks basically they were like, look, me and we're going to we're going, we're going to just we're going to take you off in the helicopter take. So I'm out in the jungle.

00:40:14:08 - 00:40:36:20
Unknown
You're just going to get me, you know, we're going to ensure all this. They did it physically. They didn't physically put their hands on me, but I was sitting in a chair and I was handcuffed to the chair, and I couldn't. So basically, you know, it was just this this like harassment. Towards the end of his confinement, a lieutenant colonel from the Air Force visited with this colonel bore no name tag, nor did he disclose his identity.

00:40:36:20 - 00:40:57:13
Unknown
The Colonel threatened against life, repeatedly telling him this clandestine operation would have no trouble leaving Wigan dead in the jungle. The Colonel then made way. Ghantt signed multiple documents, securing his silence on his incredible yet horrific encounter. And he told me, you know, you know, you know, if we just, took you out in the jungle, you know, they'd never find you out there.

00:40:57:17 - 00:41:15:06
Unknown
Point. And, you know, I didn't want to say you, you know, I didn't want to test to see if you really do that. So I said, yeah. So you got to sign these papers. You never saw this. I don't exist in this situation. Never happened. And if you tell anybody, you know, you know, you'll just come up missing.

00:41:15:06 - 00:41:44:01
Unknown
And and he was real abrasive. Just just listening, cynical. I guess the best way to put it, he had. Know what what papers. Well, they were it was the standard form that you sign for. It's like it's almost like a waiver. I don't know. I'd probably be out there. I found other people like the. I guess it's it's for if you've if you've seen something you're not supposed to sign that you didn't see it or whatever, just based on the security form.

00:41:44:03 - 00:42:10:08
Unknown
And there was two of those that are fine. And then after that, I was driven back to my base. Jonathan was finally driven back to his original radar installation. This is a key point here for our upcoming investigation, where it was in close enough proximity to be driven back to the original base and not flown. I don't remember leaving, no, but I know I went out because they, they, they put a, they put a mask over me.

00:42:10:09 - 00:42:28:10
Unknown
I had a mask over me when I, when I got to the base, they put it on before I got out of the helicopter. And, when I left from where I was, where they held me, they put one on, I mean, it had something open where I could breathe, but I couldn't see and I couldn't hear.

00:42:28:10 - 00:42:54:00
Unknown
And they brought me out and they took me to this file on Jonathan was segregate it with USAF personnel at his original base for three weeks before being sent back to Cherry Point. While there, Jonathan had no opportunity to contact Allen Adkins or the other Marines. By May of 97, while still in service, Jonathan became tormented by the event, experiencing horrific nightmares, missing time, and weird dreams.

00:42:54:01 - 00:43:20:18
Unknown
None of these symptoms had occurred before witnessing the crash. To this day, Jonathan maintains, there were internal USMC attempts to make him appear unstable and an unreliable witness. By late 97, Jonathan confessed to using banned substances so he could be discharged by the Marines. Around this time, Mack G, 28, and the Criminal Investigation Division made his life horrific and by March of 1998, Wiggin was discharged.

00:43:20:19 - 00:43:34:23
Unknown
Now let's move over to investigating the retrieval encounter in extreme detail, an attempt to break down every single detail of this retrieval.

00:43:35:01 - 00:43:56:12
Unknown
After we climbed back up the, the the I think the you Department of Energy people were there. They knew about it. And I don't know why we went there still to this day. But anyway, I was arrested. I had all my gear taken from me by men in black jammies, had no no name tags. They were older men, probably in their late 30s or 40s.

00:43:56:14 - 00:44:17:08
Unknown
I got a little scuffle with them and I hit one. I took a swing one, and I hit him in the forehead that they have. Yeah, they had they had the big D, you know, Delta Oscar echo on the back of their back. And a couple the guys were wearing like these, these rain jackets because it had been raining for the previous day.

00:44:17:08 - 00:44:25:01
Unknown
And they were in there and they were other guys were wearing containment like biological suits.

00:44:25:03 - 00:44:44:21
Unknown
Yeah, it wasn't like that. It was more high tech like this. Big jumpsuits zip up the back and you can, like, we're breathing apparatus in there. Those guys, there's about 30 of them at least. And they marched right by me as I was. I was being taken away. They were marching to get down the cliff. I guess they were in there to check this thing out on their black uniforms.

00:44:44:21 - 00:45:01:03
Unknown
Was there any, rank? No. No rank. Okay. No nametags. None of that. But when you encounter these guys, was there any semblance that there was a hierarchy? Oh, yeah. There were definitely. Yeah, there was definitely Howard the team leader. Was he an aggressive one or. They were all aggressive. I just I don't know, man, to be honest with you.

00:45:01:03 - 00:45:25:14
Unknown
Could you gauge the temperament of the Doe team? Did they seem to focus on the mission? What? No. They were kind of like power man going crazy, running around, swarming like rats. Maybe. Equipment? Yeah. I don't know what it was. Before we investigate, let's quickly review Jonathan's encounter with this unknown military and scientific team near the crash site, ignoring cries of danger by Sergeant Allen and Sergeant Adkins.

00:45:25:14 - 00:45:51:13
Unknown
Lance Corporal Wakey, but only 15 to 20 minutes at the crash site before 2 to 4 U.S. Army 47 Chinooks began to land in the nearby hasty LZ. Climbing out of the ravine, the Marines were met by operators in black kameez, featuring no insignia or identification. These operators, who spoke with American dialects, likely arrived prior to the teams in the 40s and disarmed and apprehended the Marines.

00:45:51:13 - 00:46:14:13
Unknown
Being a rambunctious young soldier, Wiggins took a swing at one of the clandestine operators, connecting his fist with the man's head. These rogue operators restrained Jonathan and forcefully laid him face down on the ground, where he got more of the strange, clear, syrupy liquid on him. While Jonathan was being restrained, a group of maybe 30 began walking from the landed 40 sevens down into the crash site in the ravine.

00:46:14:14 - 00:46:44:23
Unknown
The personnel were comprised largely of men in rain jackets marked Delta Oscar, Echo or DoD, aka the Department of Energy. Alongside these men were multiple individuals in suits and hazmat gear Jonathan described as mission oriented protective posture or mop gear. Jonathan was forced to strip to his underwear, discarding the clothes covered in the mysterious liquid by the suit clad DoD personnel before having his hands cuffed, feet bound, and he was then carried onto a stretcher to one of the 40 Sevens.

00:46:45:03 - 00:47:11:11
Unknown
Jonathan was not taken aboard with Sergeant Atkins and Sergeant Allen, but instead isolated and forcefully taken to an unknown camp. Let's pause here and break this down. Jonathan's mention of dodgy assets in the Peruvian jungle gives us some extremely actionable data points. Remember, Wiggin and his fellow Marines learned about the crash between 11 p.m. and midnight, departed to investigate around 3 to 4 a.m. and arrived to the crash site around 6 to 7 a.m..

00:47:11:11 - 00:47:35:11
Unknown
From intelligence to arrival, the Marines took a maximum of eight hours in roughly the same time span, plus maybe an extra hour or two if the department of Energy was privy to advanced signals intelligence of the UFO being targeted, possibly by Peruvian Hawk Min 23 missile batteries, the D.o.e. was able to mobilize American personnel, assets and containment suits to secure the crash area.

00:47:35:14 - 00:48:22:15
Unknown
This would imply the recovery team was highly organized and likely a rapid reaction recovery unit. This unit was able to plan, mobilize, execute, and contain a UFO crash retrieval site within roughly 8 to 9 hours. Remember back to my work on USO retrievals in the Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle under Project Sand Dollars. Such submersibles were deployable anywhere in the world within 72 hours, this 30 plus man team was able to deploy and react to Peru in roughly 11% of that 72 hours in numerous videos in the past, I have spoken about UFO crash retrieval, rapid recovery units, whether this be the USAF Blue Berets allegedly on site for the 1965 Kecksburg Pennsylvania crash retrieval, the

00:48:22:15 - 00:48:57:14
Unknown
Blue Boys Rapid Retrieval and Transport helicopter units relayed to Leonard Stringfield, or the Rapid Response USAF unit, first on site the 1953 Kingman, Arizona crash. Stories of highly structured and efficient dedicated UFO recovery units are inseparable from UFO crash retrieval testimonies. In fact, wagon's description of the site team reminds me extremely closely of an enigmatic, brutal and perplexing UFO crash recovery case I have covered before in extreme detail the 1974 Koyama Mexico UFO crash retrieval.

00:48:57:14 - 00:49:26:22
Unknown
This case has very little in the form of evidence based paper trails, but outlines an incredible and logical crash retrieval encounter, in this case, U.S. intelligence agencies, specifically the CIA, monitored a UFO from the Gulf of Mexico that, after a series of jagged and abrupt turns, crashed into the northern Chihuahuan part of Mexico. According to the primary source document of this case, the allegedly leaked Deneb report, the CIA mobilized a rapid recovery unit out of Fort Bliss, Texas.

00:49:26:22 - 00:49:51:00
Unknown
This team arrived on site from four unmarked helicopters, including U1 Huey's and 53 Super Stallions equipped with hazmat gear. Hazmat or Mop gear was required at this crash site, according to the Deneb report, because of a whole containment breach of toxic materials, gas or liquid out of the UFO that subsequently killed the Mexican military retrieval team. There is, of course, an argument.

00:49:51:00 - 00:50:27:18
Unknown
The U.S. Rapid Recovery Team killed these Mexican soldiers. But that is not our topic. Let's remain in 1974 to attempt to uncover the origins of this Doi team. This year saw the creation of the Department of Energy and National Nuclear Security Administration's Nuclear Emergency Support Team, formerly known as the Nuclear Emergency Search Team, aka Nest. Previously, I have labeled Nest as the on site retrieval science team wagon encountered in the jungles of Peru in 1997, just like other excellent researchers like UFOs did before me.

00:50:27:22 - 00:51:19:11
Unknown
Today, however, I have even stronger conviction. Nest handled the recovery of a non-human vehicle and hazardous containment breach of a mysterious liquid suffered by a young marine during Operation Laser Strike. But what is this nest? Nest or Nuclear Emergency Support Team was created under Executive Order one, two, 656. Nest was founded as a Doe specialized nuclear emergency organization that assisted the FBI and numerous government agencies by, quote, provide technical expertise and advice in response to a variety of potential incident threats involving nuclear materials and, quote, analyzing the 1996 Nest briefing, the closest available document to the time of our crash, Nest engaged in myriad deployment activities, serving as an operational emergency management Team or EMT,

00:51:19:11 - 00:51:44:21
Unknown
and also as a threat credibility assessor, ensuring Nest was the quote unquote, initial party to the scene on mission deployment sites, nest would restrict access, perform diagnostics and threat mitigation actions, agency planning and coordination, as well as handle disablement and cleanup. Ensure that Nest operated as an umbrella organization to handle all nuclear and radiological emergencies for the Department of Energy.

00:51:44:21 - 00:52:14:06
Unknown
The mission of Nest is to be, quote, prepared to respond immediately to any type of radiological accident or incident anywhere in the world. End quote. Around 1996, nest enjoyed its own arsenal of vehicles, including high tech vans and BBO, 105 helicopters, and numerous jets, including Cessna Citation Twos that featured a max speed of 464mph. And remember that speed as it will become quite important later on.

00:52:14:11 - 00:52:47:09
Unknown
Now it is crucial to mention nest personnel did not consist of armed operators. Therefore, it is safe to assume the operators in black Cams were not nest operators, though it is possible they were still d.o.e. assets. We will get to that soon. Personnel in Nest circa 1996 included chemists, engineers, health physicists, management and logistic personnel, nuclear physicists, analysts, etc. the corporate team members of the Nuclear Emergency Support Team consisted of some familiar faces to this channel.

00:52:47:11 - 00:53:30:05
Unknown
Nest forces have historically been comprised of contractors rather than the Department of Defense. Not only did Nest partner with Raytheon, but also Los Alamos National Labs, Sandia National Labs, and Lawrence Livermore National Labs. As we discussed earlier, a cornerstone of my work is discussing the missing link of U.S. government corporate UFO legacy programs, the subject matter expert, federally funded research and development centers, or for ADCs alongside institutions like the Miter Corporation, Rand Corporation, center for Naval Analyzes, Los Alamos, Sandia, and Lawrence Livermore National Labs operate as FFR DCS for the U.S. Department of Defense.

00:53:30:11 - 00:54:00:20
Unknown
Sandia and Lawrence Livermore were also directly accused by USF Master Sergeant Edgar Shay as engineering the propulsion devices from the reverse engineered triangular craft, the TR three B. I have also discussed Sandia National Labs as implicated in UFO technology transfer with AT&T and Bell Labs, as well as serving as a UFO legacy program location to house craft and biologics as outlined in the disputed majestic 12 and Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit documents.

00:54:00:22 - 00:54:38:23
Unknown
And a quick side note while these documents I just mentioned may be disputed, the interplanetary Phenomenon Unit was proven to exist through FOIA requests done by UFO researcher William Steinman in the 1980s. However, according to the Army, no records of this unit existed due to it existing only through institutional memory. Los Alamos, Sandia, and Lawrence Livermore are labs intimately entwined with UFO lore, quite recently, I discussed provable subterranean facilities existing below Sandia and Los Alamos and their possible connection to UFO legacy programs, and one of NASA's partners, e.g., really needs no introduction.

00:54:38:23 - 00:55:17:19
Unknown
This former contractor is infamous in UFO lore, serving as the contractor Bob Lazar claimed employed him to attempt to reverse engineer UFO propulsion devices at area 51 for in Nevada. Parking lot also served as the meeting place for the disputed but likely accurate 2002 Wilson Davis meeting. Notes. Funny enough, nest themselves in a 1995 nest Assessment Team report stated, quote, the laboratory program managers enjoy a relatively high degree of autonomy and independence with respect to focusing efforts and funding on those elements of their internal program, which they have deemed to be the most important.

00:55:17:19 - 00:55:53:18
Unknown
End quote. This intriguing and free management style around Nest Laboratories arose from the laboratory's heavy focus on research and development activities during formative years under Executive Order 12656, which created Nest, the primary authority to Nest was the 1954 Atomic Energy Act. Mention of the Atomic Energy Commission's Atomic Energy Act of 1954 should immediately set off alarm bells. This 1954 act has been labeled specifically in the Schumer round's legislation as a system for misclassifying UFO data and materials.

00:55:53:18 - 00:56:24:01
Unknown
Historically misclassifying them as trans classified foreign nuclear information or by the acronym TFN I. Whether the UFO wagon encountered emitted signs of radiological signatures when tracked by laser strike radar or intelligence agency radars, matters not, as UFO materials have historically been hidden within the exact 1954 act that provided oversight to Nest. However, it is indeed possible this craft emitted signatures of interest to attract the eyes of the Doe.

00:56:24:03 - 00:56:54:08
Unknown
Recently, I covered a 1991 Deep-Sea UFO retrieval case, in which a triangular craft that had sat on the sea for 30 or 40 years was recovered by a naval DSV crew due to survey ships recognizing radioactive signatures from the seafloor. Further intriguing links exist between Jonathan's testimony and nest. In February of 1997, just 1 to 2 months before wagons encounter, nest introduced the JTF, OT or Joint Technical Operations Team.

00:56:54:08 - 00:57:23:21
Unknown
This team aimed to provide deployable and tactical operational support for Nest to DoD at even faster speeds than present Nest teams, and this team operated 365 days a year at 24 hours a day. Let's reference Defuzing Armageddon Inside Nest America's Secret Nuclear Bomb squad, by author Jeffrey T Richardson, the same author of the US intelligence community that provided extremely valuable information on the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office.

00:57:24:02 - 00:57:49:07
Unknown
Around 1997, Russia blasted a probe from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan carrying the Mars 96 probe. The fourth stage of this proton rocket failed, leaving the rocket unable to escape Earth. Mars 96 did not carry an onboard nuclear reactor, but did in fact carry 18 small energy generators powered by plutonium 238, but this was enough to get Nest's attention.

00:57:49:07 - 00:58:18:13
Unknown
U.S. Space Command estimated the probe was large enough. Some pieces would survive reentry, and the unlucky countries of origin were estimated to be Bolivia or Columbia. NASA debated deployment to Bolivia or Columbia, two countries considered quote unquote not very important, but ceased action once surviving debris landed west of South America in the Pacific Ocean. What is interesting here is that the same year wake chance encounter, NASA considered deployment to recover a probe in countries neighboring Peru.

00:58:18:13 - 00:58:48:10
Unknown
Next acted off intelligence gathered from U.S. Space Command and their defense support Program DSP satellites. And now I have made an entire video on the subject of fast walkers, a term used by us, Northcom and Nora, to designate any strange object leaving or entering Earth's atmosphere at incredible speeds. In the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign leaks, communications were found between Clinton campaign manager John Podesta and USG contractor Bob fish.

00:58:48:10 - 00:59:20:08
Unknown
In these exchanges, Phish stated, quote, one of the government programs that collects hard data on unidentified flying objects is the USAF DSP satellite program and quote. In the same video, I covered an incredible DSP Fast Walker case related journalist and former Army Criminal Investigation Command agent Joseph's to follow this case allegedly saw a UFO traveling at 22,000mph towards Earth Pass within 1.5 miles of a DSP satellite before changing course.

00:59:20:08 - 00:59:45:19
Unknown
And by the way, guess which U.S agency has a history of developing and managing DSP satellites? Yes, the NRO or National Reconnaissance Office. Remember from numerous projects of mine and the incredible articles of Chris Sharpe, the NRO has been labeled time and time again as a Big five U.S. intelligence agency that provides various forms of satellite intelligence for UFO, domestic and foreign crash retrieval incidents.

00:59:45:21 - 01:00:09:20
Unknown
All this out of Jeffrey Richardson's work is to say that there are provable instances of DSP satellites and nest working in conjunction the same year as Wiggins testimony to cover debris in South America. I think for Wiggins case, it is highly likely the NRO managed DSP satellite monitoring the egg shaped crafts crashing in Peru and deployed a Nest Rapid Recovery unit to secure the site.

01:00:10:01 - 01:00:53:18
Unknown
What strengthens this thesis even more is the fact Wiggins himself mentioned a bunker below the laser strike radar station that was tracking UFOs. As we discussed while performing perimeter security, Wiggin would state how he overheard USAF personnel discussing aircraft flying in and out of atmosphere at Mach ten plus or almost 70 700mph. Also recalled how Wiggins mentioned U.S. Army 47 deploying the Doe team in a declassified 1995 Nest assessment team report, we can see the Doe insured with the Department of Defense that suitable military aircraft would be made immediately available to support an emergency deployment of Nest forces and equipment.

01:00:53:20 - 01:01:21:09
Unknown
Nest also worked closely with the US Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division and U.S. Army 52nd Ordnance Group. It is possible in this instance the 47 belong to Nest Army Partners. Indeed, the U.S. Army South did begin supporting counter drug operations in South America in 1995 by providing aircraft such as for U8 60 A or Blackhawks for such operations until 1st November 1997.

01:01:21:09 - 01:01:46:07
Unknown
But what I think here is that it's quite probable these Army 47, used to transport the Nest team were from the first Battalion, two 28th Aviation Regiment 1 to 2. Weight aviation is part of Joint Task Force Bravo, a U.S South Com forward based expeditionary task force operating to promote stability and security by countering transnational threats, including narco traffic.

01:01:46:07 - 01:02:13:20
Unknown
Throughout the 90s, JTF Bravo conducted numerous missions in Central and South America and saw the U.S. Army's seven special forces. We discussed earlier work alongside the 1/28 aviation in support of the Peru Ecuador 1995 border dispute, and interestingly enough, throughout the 90s, one two 28th aviation had headquartered in Panama in Honduras and featured a fleet of helicopters, including 47 Chinooks.

01:02:14:02 - 01:02:42:06
Unknown
I do need to quickly mention we are faced with an additional possibility of the origin of these helicopters as we move on to discuss the black operators and U.S. Special forces, we must also discuss the 1/60 Special Operations Aviation Regiment, a U.S. Army Special Forces Special Mission unit that provides helicopter aviation support for special operations forces. Nicknamed the Night Stalkers, the 1/60 often works with Joint Special Operations Command.

01:02:42:08 - 01:03:06:15
Unknown
The Night Stalkers are some of the Army's greatest qualified aviators, crew chiefs, and support soldiers and employ a massive fleet of helicopters, including numerous 47 Chinooks. The Night Stalkers have even deployed on several missions of interest here, including recovering a downed Soviet helicopter in June of 1988. Now, there is no record of the Night Stalkers performing operations in South America during the 1990s.

01:03:06:15 - 01:03:38:01
Unknown
In fact, closest we can get is deployment out of Panama for Operation Desert Storm in 91. Obviously, with special forces operations, there would likely be next to no record of covert activities by the 1/60 sonar in the region. But the reason, I suspect the 128th aviation from JTF Bravo 47 Chinooks were used over the highly qualified Special Operations Force the night Stalkers is because of provable C8 47th, existing under the 128th Aviation and South Comms domain.

01:03:38:01 - 01:04:05:03
Unknown
At the time of our crash retrieval incident, the Night Stalkers are stationed out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and it is technically impossible for the team to have flown Chinooks to Peru and commence the operation in the roughly nine hours we outlined for the Dot team. But this is all to say, it is very possible. Elements of the Night Stalkers were stationed in South Comms domain as part of a UFO rapid recovery team, especially if Laser Strike had already monitored numerous UFOs.

01:04:05:03 - 01:04:29:02
Unknown
But for now, we are forced to look at provable existing vehicles in the region that would satisfy the retrieval operation. And now this brings us to the armed men in black kameez with no insignia. I do think we are faced with a few possibilities here in the same 1995 Nest Assessment Team report, we can see nest additionally worked alongside U.S. special operations in U.S. Navy Special operations.

01:04:29:08 - 01:04:54:11
Unknown
I have often spoken reflected on the work of excellent journalist Chris Sharp, exposing the CIA's Office of Global Access. Born in 2003 out of the CIA Directorate of Science and Technology, the Office of Global Access, or Ogah, was accused by sharp as participating in foreign UFO crash recovery operations, while Oga provided operational logistics and intelligence agencies provided various forms of intelligence.

01:04:54:11 - 01:05:29:16
Unknown
Sharp labeled JSO or Joint Special Operations Command as serving as the boots on the ground force for such retrieval operations, and as we discussed earlier, Joint Special Operations Command is a subordinate command within Special Operations Command. Sharp, myself and others have accused JSO in the so com as participating directly in UFO crash retrievals. Interestingly, JSO is comprised of the best of the best of US Special Forces Delta Force, Seal team six, the 24th STS Regimental Reconnaissance Company, and the Intelligence Support Activity.

01:05:29:18 - 01:05:59:08
Unknown
The shadowy Intelligence support activity is often known as the most mysterious unit of JSO. Task Force orange, as it sometimes referred to, was originally created under U.S. Army Comm or Intelligence and Security Command. U.S. Army INS comm was created under General Albert's double. Been a figure famous in UFO lore, stubble bin showed keen interest in utilizing sci fi phenomena such as remote viewing for military usage, and has also been accused by numerous individuals such as Philip J.

01:05:59:08 - 01:06:24:05
Unknown
Corso and Steven Greer as participating directly in UFO Legacy Program operations at Fort Hutch, Ukiah, Arizona. All this is to say, I do think it is highly likely wagon encountered unmarked so Com or SoC units alongside the Doe team. The question here is were these units currently stationed in Peru for laser strike or deployed rapidly from a base similar to the D.o.e. nest crew?

01:06:24:08 - 01:06:50:18
Unknown
This is up for debate, but I do have my own strong thesis here. Let's break this down. We did state during his deployment performing perimeter security for laser strike. He did encounter special forces operators training as a matter of fact, U.S Special Forces were deployed to Peru during this time. Let us analyze in 1996 to 1997 document pulled from the Defense Technical Information Center titled the US Military and Drug War in Peru.

01:06:50:23 - 01:07:17:02
Unknown
As we mentioned earlier, this document details 14 special forces counter drug deployments to Peru conducted by US South Comm or U.S Southern Command. These forces would regularly engage in riverine training, as it turns out, and this will become extremely important soon. U.S Health Comm held the Ma for Marine Forces Atlantic Riverine Training Team in Iquitos, Peru for utilization under Operation Laser Strike.

01:07:17:05 - 01:07:42:16
Unknown
Iquitos is a host to all sorts of U.S. military installations of interest we will touch on soon. Circling back, there is the South Comm Unit deployed to Peru in 1997. We discussed earlier, I highly suspect, did indeed intercept Wiggin and his fellow Marines and secured a UFO crash site. These being the US Army seventh Special Forces Unit, aka the US Army Green Berets.

01:07:42:18 - 01:08:12:00
Unknown
Due to their consistent execution of US South Comm missions, including a historical presence, training and countering narcotic distribution in Central and South America, especially in northern Peru. I wager here the Army seventh Special Forces were, quote unquote, recruited by Doughy Ness to serve as the enforcement arm of a UFO crash retrieval operation. Now, there is a secondary argument here of who these operators could be far less likely, in my opinion, but still worth exploring.

01:08:12:06 - 01:08:37:07
Unknown
This being the Department of Energy Special Response Team, these anti-nuclear terrorist teams are the Doe's own elite task force, an elite operator force entrusted with moving nuclear arsenals across the continental United States. The Special Response Team has a rest on site authority and, at least in the 1980s, donned all black kameez similar to their outfits described by Gant.

01:08:37:09 - 01:09:19:00
Unknown
Historically, in the late 90s, D.o.e. SRT units also provided security for sensitive Doe defense nuclear facilities, including Los Alamos National Labs and Lawrence Livermore National Labs. Sound familiar? These teams were trained by Wackenhut. Wackenhut was a private security company I have talked about extensively, had historically guarded USA legacy program sites through their industrial security expertise. Former CIA director and director of Naval Intelligence Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who admitted to NASA mission specialist Bob Esler recovered UFOs May 1st day become available for scientific research, once served as chairman of Wackenhut.

01:09:19:04 - 01:09:41:22
Unknown
While I can find no data to suggest D.o.e. cities have ever operated outside of the United States, it stands to reason such a team could travel with nest assets to incredibly sensitive materials, such as a crashed UFO protected by the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement Act.

01:09:42:00 - 01:10:12:23
Unknown
After all, our investigation into the team with Delta Oskar Echo on their protection suits and rain jackets, as well as the armed anonymous Americans and black kameez, I think we can construct a powerful thesis for US forces engaged in counter-narcotics reconnaissance systems for Operation Laser Strike, monitored a UFO in addition to radar. It is likely the Defense Support Program satellites run by the NRO either picked up the same UFO or elements of laser strike were also involved with the Defense Support program.

01:10:13:01 - 01:10:36:19
Unknown
The UFO then crashed in Wiggins estimate. This crash was cost, as we discussed earlier by Peruvian Air Force surface to Air Hawk MIM 23 missile batteries from data gathered by intelligence sources, likely DSP with support from the NRO, a D.o.e. nest retrieval team was dispatched via internal Nest jet assets with a point of origin in the mainland United States.

01:10:36:19 - 01:11:12:00
Unknown
The southernmost Nest facility here is Sandia National Labs in New Mexico. The Nest team either departed with a D.o.e. Special Response Team, SRT or leveraged Green Beret Special Forces assets to provide onsite protection for securing the crash zone. Nest also leveraged further DoD authority. Several U.S. Army's 47 Chinooks from either the 1/60 S.O.S. are night Stalkers or 1 to 2 eighth aviation from JTF Bravo stationed nearby in South Territory during the crash, recovery and deployment of on site directives nest.

01:11:12:00 - 01:11:39:16
Unknown
In the first two arrived, armed entourage encountered a group of Marines that had happened upon the crash site. First, one marine resisted detainment and was confined due to coming in contact with possibly hazardous materials leaking from the non-human craft. The young marine was stripped of his contaminated clothes by nest personnel in biohazard suits, isolated from his fellow Marines, and taken to a secure base with medical facilities for quarantine, interrogation and debrief.

01:11:39:16 - 01:12:02:09
Unknown
The Mak G, 28 marine, was held in isolation for up to 48 hours, threatened repeatedly and forced under fear of death to sign confidentiality agreements. The marine was then driven back to his operational base, where he was soon forced to return to Cherry Point, North Carolina. Okay, now that we have outlined our thesis, let's step back and explore this piece by piece.

01:12:02:14 - 01:12:37:04
Unknown
We must start by analyzing where exactly was Jonathan Wiggins stationed and where May of this crash occurred. Operation Laser Strike was conducted primarily in two Kalpa Peru. However, there were two secondary locations that supported Operation Laser Strike and Peruvian Counter Drug Operations, while also featuring TPS 43 radar systems within Iquitos and Indo US. Many familiar with the case of Wigand believes he was stationed at Pu Kalpa, the primary laser strike facility, and while this is indeed possible, I would like to propose a secondary possible station.

01:12:37:06 - 01:12:59:10
Unknown
Elements of laser strike are still classified to this day, and I know this because I have spoken to one of the Marines where Ghantt described he was with in his testimony, the marine refused to discuss many details of laser strike with me, since the operation was still classified to me. This partially rules out poo culpa as the base at which Jonathan, Alan Adkins and others were stationed.

01:12:59:10 - 01:13:23:00
Unknown
But why? Poo culpa, at least since 2001, has received public publicity as a laser strike location. One of the Marines I talked to, s unwillingness to speak about their base of operations leads me to believe it was not poo culpa. Furthermore, Wiggins stated his unit flew into Lima, Peru via C-130, then took a multiple hour flight with one stop to travel to their operational base.

01:13:23:02 - 01:13:48:16
Unknown
Jonathan was unaware of where exactly this location was in, but Copa is around 300 miles from Lima at the crew speed of a C-130. This journey from Lima to Book Culpa would take less than one hour. However, there was a laser strike location up north in Peru that existed more than 630 miles away from Lima. At a cruising speed, a C-130 would take near two hours to complete this journey with an added stop.

01:13:48:16 - 01:14:17:04
Unknown
This satisfies our journey conditions of several hours. This laser strike location is USAF detachment five in Iquitos, Peru. Detachment five is a very private installation. I can only find one mention of in the 1990s or onward. Iquitos is home to Yousuf Radar Detachment five, the Mar four riverine training team discussed earlier in Nam Ru six, now called Nam Ru South aka the Navy Medical Research Unit.

01:14:17:06 - 01:14:39:21
Unknown
All three of these location significance will become apparent very soon, especially when we discuss the facility he was taken to by the D.o.e. team and the permanent structures there on site. Now I can find next to no information about the and Doas laser strike site, but these aforementioned locations at Iquitos lead me strongly to believe Iquitos is the correct location.

01:14:40:02 - 01:15:08:01
Unknown
We can't stated his radar station was tracking narcotics traffic from Bolivia, analyzing narco routes from 1998. We can see drug transport routes passing directly through Iquitos, Peru. But let's go step by step through the incident and try to reconstruct wagons encounter. Jonathan was informed of a crashed aircraft near 11 p.m. to midnight. By 3 to 4 a.m.. The Lance corporal, Sergeant Adkins, Sergeant Allen's and multiple Marines and Humvees departed for the crash area.

01:15:08:07 - 01:15:31:00
Unknown
After a combination of driving and trekking, the Marines reached the crash area as the sun was rising around 6 to 7 a.m.. What this means is that from the time the Marines left their base of operations, which I highly suspect is the enigmatic USAF Radar Detachment five in Iquitos, Peru. To the time the Marines got to the crash, only between 2 and 4 hours had elapsed.

01:15:31:02 - 01:15:52:06
Unknown
But let's break this down. Remember, we can't claim the Marines drove Humvees and track to the crash area. We would also make mention that while he was analyzing the craft up close, he was incredibly sweaty, but made no mention of fatigue due to the hiking. While a marine equipped with a full load out and weapon would certainly get quite sweaty quickly in the Peruvian air.

01:15:52:06 - 01:16:15:12
Unknown
Average temperatures in March in Peru are only 77¬∞F, with the sunrise temp being much cooler. Due to these factors, we will take the average time elapsed to the crash site three hours and assume the Marines drove for 2.5 hours and tracked for 30 minutes. Humvees drive at max speeds of 70mph, but operate conservatively, especially on jungle terrain and roads.

01:16:15:14 - 01:16:37:17
Unknown
Therefore, we will assume the caravan of Marines traveled at 35mph at 2.5 hours of driving. This means if the Marines traveled in a straight line, the soldiers could have traveled near 88 miles. The average human hikes at roughly 2 to 3mph. And we will assume here trained soldiers who got a pep in their step could trek two miles in 30 minutes.

01:16:37:19 - 01:16:59:01
Unknown
With this information and a tremendous amount of error, and I fully understand my calculations are based on heavy assumptions. We can assume the crash occurred in a 90 mile radius outside of Iquitos. To try and correct for some of my error here, I will give a plus minus of 25% error. We are then left with this general area of where the crash may have occurred.

01:16:59:04 - 01:17:23:16
Unknown
Now recall where it did say the crash occurred just over the border, but he stated the Bolivian border specifically 5 to 10 miles from the Bolivian border. Now, if Wiggins testimony is true, this means he either got the border of Bolivia incorrect, confusing the country with the borders of either Brazil or Colombia, or he was stationed at a secretive location in southeast Peru that featured multiple camps and permanent structures.

01:17:23:22 - 01:17:59:03
Unknown
Now, I tend to believe the former and that Jonathan misspoke as his laser strike installation was tasked with tracking Bolivian narco traffic, and Iquitos employed a significant amount of U.S. DoD permanent structures and assets that line up with Jonathan's testimony and the timeline of events. What reinforces this thesis is the point we discussed earlier that the U.S. Army Seventh Special Forces and Joint Task Force Bravo, containing the first Battalion, two 28th Aviation Regiment, had historically conducted U.S. South com missions in northern Peru during the 1955 Peru Ecuador border dispute.

01:17:59:09 - 01:18:20:13
Unknown
So it is interesting the men in black kameez, I wager, were U.S. Army seventh Special Forces were already available to secure the crash site in northern Peru. Anyways, we can conclude from the exploration above wagon. Adkins in the fellow Marines uncovered the crashed UFO 5 to 10 miles from either the Colombian or Brazilian border in one of these two general regions.

01:18:20:16 - 01:18:45:02
Unknown
Within 15 to 20 minutes, the Marines arriving the crash site were secured by multiple U.S. Army 47 helicopters, D.O.D. personnel and armed men in black kameez wig to certain arrived to the scene before the 840 sevens was almost like they were there already. They were on the ground already. They were. And and whoever was flying over was coming in after these guys had landed.

01:18:45:02 - 01:19:05:10
Unknown
So I'm. And I'm not sure where they they landed, where they were, but they were just there on top of the site within a few minutes. And so I can't remember exactly how it's speculation on your part. You don't know for sure, but you think it's possible that he may have been there first? Yeah. They all they were definitely there first and they were monitoring us to I'm sure they knew we were in the area when we got up there near.

01:19:05:12 - 01:19:32:04
Unknown
But they looked army but they didn't have, you know, insignia on them. Right. They were same color. And all this from the data we've discussed above and involvement of NRO managed ESP satellites, I wager this rapid reaction retrieval team had maybe one hour advance notice of the crash to the Marines. Therefore, let's assume this retrieval team had a maximum of nine hours to gather intelligence, assemble, brief, and reach the crash site with a detailed operational plan.

01:19:32:04 - 01:19:57:00
Unknown
Remember, at this time, NSA teams were historically stationed at U.S. Department of Energy laboratories, so I think it is extremely unlikely any team would have been stationed in South America at this time. In this instance, one of the closest major labs to Iquitos, Peru is a regular, tricky customer of this channel. Central New Mexico, Sandia National Labs and recall back to discussing nest in the 1996 Nest briefing.

01:19:57:00 - 01:20:29:23
Unknown
Nest was not only permitted to commandeer any DoD assets, but also employed their own fleet of vehicles, including Cessna Citation two jets. So my theory here would see a nest team departing Sandia heading directly to Iquitos. U.S. military infrastructure via Cessna Citation. Two jets from Iquitos are nearby South. Comments. Deletions. The team would commandeer U.S. 47 helicopters, likely from Joint Task Force Bravo, and recruit nearby special forces from the Riverine Training Team, or utilize a J soccer D.o.e. SRT team that traveled with the nest team.

01:20:30:03 - 01:21:04:23
Unknown
Sandia s nearby largest city is Santa Fe, New Mexico, and using Santa Fe as a reference point. Travel distance to Iquitos is 3446 miles. A Cessna Citation two travels at top speed of 464mph, logically assuming the team wished to arrive to the retrieval site with haste. This flight would have taken around 7.5 hours. From Iquitos, the team would have a very short flight to arrive to the crash area around 90 to 100 miles away, in a C 47 that travels 180 to 196mph at top speed.

01:21:04:23 - 01:21:34:13
Unknown
So this journey here on the shorter end would have taken roughly 30 minutes. This means the team would have only required around eight hours total of travel time, with roughly one hour left for personnel and gear gathering, necessary ground briefings, etc. a tight squeeze, but one that very well fits in the framework of Wigan's testimony. And then they took me in the siege 47 and they, they sent me to we, we took off and, and then they, they didn't drug me or anything like that.

01:21:34:13 - 01:22:01:10
Unknown
And I was just awake here and they had me and you know, and your question again is how long it was like contained. You. I was there for about two days. I think I'm on holiday, but I don't know where I was because we landed and, we, we flew and then we landed and then, they took me out and it was still, I mean, you know, it wasn't in the same area that it was out.

01:22:01:12 - 01:22:25:07
Unknown
This is more like there were structures, permanent structures there. I think it was Peruvian military. But all this thing is how I saw there was Americans and there's a lot of other nationalities. There were Chinese, Germans, I think were there I mean, a lot of the people working at this other base. But, I mean, this thing was really I mean, I didn't go in and all they did was take me to like a, like a you couldn't go out.

01:22:25:07 - 01:23:05:06
Unknown
So it was more of like, it was more like an interrogation room. And I said a more friendly 15 hours. Lance Corporal Wakhan was isolated from Adkins, Allen and the other Marines. He was flown to a location that was not his base of operations, which I wager was in Iquitos. Now, what's interesting is this location was close enough to his original station that after 1 to 2 days of captivity, it was driven back before being kept with USAF personnel for three weeks, another nod towards Iquitos being the correct location with USAF detachment five before being shipped back to Cherry Point at this interrogation room, where it was contained, isolated and threatened by some of

01:23:05:06 - 01:23:29:01
Unknown
the operators and black kameez, and was then forced to sign documents swearing his silence by Yousuf Colonel. Describing this location, Wignot made a very interesting set of remarks. The location at which he was interrogated employed permanent structures, not makeshift forward operating bases like pool copper laser strike location. It was at this base where he was interrogated. He observed multiple different nationalities in one area.

01:23:29:01 - 01:23:53:19
Unknown
Americans, Peruvians, Chinese and Germans also recall twice waking got the mysterious liquid leaking from the craft on him once during his initial investigation of the crash site, and a second time when the black operators forcefully took him to the ground. Wigan also stated here the dot team in hazmat gear stripped his clothes covered in the liquid due to these statements, plus Ghantt being isolated from Adkins and Allen.

01:23:53:19 - 01:24:21:18
Unknown
I do think it likely that doing this team had concerns Wakan was contaminated from interacting with the liquid. For this reason I do have high suspicion. Wakin was taken to Nam Ru 6 or 9 Amaru South, the Navy Medical Research Unit with offices in Lima, Peru, and Iquitos. The US Navy employs various Nam Ru locations around the globe which serve as D.O.D. laboratories and centers Nam, USA at Joint Base San Antonio, Texas.

01:24:21:18 - 01:24:56:14
Unknown
Namur three formerly in Egypt, now in second L.A. Naval Air Station, Sicily, Italy. Mamoru Indo Pacific in Singapore. Naval Base Nam Rou South, with offices in Lima and I, Quito, Peru and Nam Rudy at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Namor locations absolutely fit the dictionary definition of multicultural environments. Naru installations serve as a network of biomedical research labs operated by the U.S. Navy, who operates to conduct R&D on infectious diseases, biodefense, and numerous medical topics related to military and public health.

01:24:56:16 - 01:25:20:10
Unknown
Namor was part of the Navy Medical Research Command that conducts biomedical research to meet the needs of the Navy and Marine Corps, German National List that specifically Nam Rou South are also not uncommon. Even in 2023, we can find examples of German military and ambassadors visiting Rose Lima location. In my opinion, Namor would serve as a perfect location for Jonathan to be taken.

01:25:20:10 - 01:25:42:11
Unknown
This location is within driving distance to Iquitos, USF detachment five and close to the U.S.. Mar four Riverine Training Team. And obviously, this location is a sensible holding and quarantine zone for a U.S. marine who was exposed to possibly toxic materials in non-human craft. Now, I do need to mention, of course, this theory is not without its own kinks.

01:25:42:11 - 01:26:08:01
Unknown
We can't stated he was only at this location for two days, and while he was contained in an interrogation type room, he was still in close proximity to the USAF lieutenant colonel. That forced him to sign papers and the operator who threatened his life. One might assume Waggoner would have had to be quarantined for up to a week in isolation, and would have had to undergo numerous medical procedures to determine if any risk of sickness or contamination resided from the fluid.

01:26:08:03 - 01:26:35:13
Unknown
And it did specifically tell me he did not have to undergo any sort of medical procedures at this location. Other factors at play do need to be worked through for this Nam. Through theory, such as the multinationals, Jonathan described being armed operators and not diplomats as well as this holding location being underground. Remember, this crash occurring near Iquitos is just a theory of mind constructed from the best available evidence for this crash retrieval testimony.

01:26:35:19 - 01:26:49:22
Unknown
But even so, I do believe I. Cato's Peru, serves as the primary focus for our UFO crash retrieval and forced holding of Lance corporal Jonathan Wiggins.

01:26:50:00 - 01:27:16:04
Unknown
I have contacted countless individuals named by Wiggins or possibly involved in this crash retrieval case. These include multiple USAF personnel from Iquitos, detachment five, including Lieutenant Colonel Gaylor Biles, Second Lieutenant Randall Rothman, and Staff Sergeant Robert McLeod. Of the six 49th Combat Logistics Support Squadron. This outreach was conducted in an attempt to identify if I ketosis was indeed where it was stationed.

01:27:16:04 - 01:27:41:09
Unknown
I plan to inquire if U.S. Marines from the Maxx G 28 performed perimeter security for this site. If a team ever stationed briefly at detachment five or borrowed their aircraft, or if stories floated around of a marine who went missing, that turned up two days later. As of today, I have had no luck contacting any USAF personnel involved in laser strike due to repeatedly hearing that some details of the OP are still classified.

01:27:41:09 - 01:28:08:08
Unknown
I am not holding my breath. However, I will continue to pursue any and all leads. Jonathan Wagner did directly state a staff sergeant. Monta Lee gray knew about the crash site, and that Sergeant Allen and Sergeant Adkins had both accompanied wagon to the site and observed the crash date with 100% confidence. I have identified all three of these men, and all three are real USMC veterans and enjoyed long accomplished careers with the corps.

01:28:08:08 - 01:28:29:19
Unknown
After laser strike and I reached out to all three on multiple platforms, and as of this date, only one marine has responded. I choose to keep the identity of this marine anonymous out of respect to the individual and to his service to the United States. I will also refrain from posting screenshots, as I do not wish to break this individual's trust, nor do I have his permission to do so.

01:28:29:22 - 01:29:03:06
Unknown
I reached out to these Marines from this channel's email address UAP GA about gmail.com, which I highly encourage any firsthand UFO legacy program witnesses to contact. This email does not contain my identity. To protect my anonymity, I emailed one of these sergeants asking to talk to him about his service during laser strike in 1996 to 1997. I did also state that my outreach concerned an encounter relayed by a mack G 28 Lance corporal, but withheld war against name, who claimed he, alongside a handful of sergeants, encountered a unique downed aircraft.

01:29:03:08 - 01:29:27:08
Unknown
The sergeant responded hello and addressed me. Gerb by both my first and my last name. In this exchange, the sergeant continued, quote. The operation is still classified. However, there was no incident involving a unique downed aircraft that I know of or encountered during my deployment. I can speak to. It never happened during my deployment and not crossed the classification restrictions of the operation.

01:29:27:08 - 01:29:46:16
Unknown
End quote. The sergeant reckoned I had received bad Intel regarding his involvement in the suggested incident I was pursuing. I then asked the marine if he had ever heard of a lance corporal, testimony of a crashed egg shaped vehicle that involved several other Marines that may have been downed by human military assets such as Hawkman 23 missile batteries.

01:29:46:22 - 01:30:08:05
Unknown
The marine responded. He was aware of a lance corporal wagon that served under his platoon. Much of this response by the sergeant focused on hawk surface to air missile systems, and the impossibility that the USMC employed a Hawk battery during 1997. And of course, we can't agree with this point. Hawk missile batteries were phased out of U.S. forces in 1994.

01:30:08:10 - 01:30:29:14
Unknown
The Marine Corps continued usage until 2002, but Laser Strike ceased usage of Hawk in 1997. Since his original testimony, Waggoner only theorized that this craft had been hit by a Hawk system and that the missile battery likely belonged to local Peruvian forces, and Wigand held this theory due to the ballistic and fragging pattern of damage on the egg shaped craft.

01:30:29:16 - 01:30:54:16
Unknown
Wiggins spent a tremendous amount of time studying Hawkman 23 systems and maintains this conclusion to this day. The sergeant not only claimed was never deployed in support of Operation Laser Strike, but also stated Wiggins story was false, and while he was a good, young, respectful, obedient and dedicated marine, he also suffered a medical condition. Quote. He was never a participant in any clandestine operations or efforts.

01:30:54:16 - 01:31:14:06
Unknown
He was just an Ladi marine and that was all. End quote. Now let me be clear here. I fully respect this marine in question. After all, he dedicated much of his life to the service of this country. But I do have quite a few problems here with his statements. Jonathan Wagner never once claimed to participate in any clandestine operations.

01:31:14:06 - 01:31:36:13
Unknown
This encounter simply involved a group of Mac G, 28 Marines sent out by the radar detachment to secure the life of a downed aircraft, the Matt G, 28 Marines in this testimony clearly conflicted with the clandestine mission of the Donis team. I also find the claims we can't never deploy to laser strike. To be quite curious, laser strike was indeed a classified mission.

01:31:36:13 - 01:32:02:22
Unknown
The marine I spoke to claimed it may have picked up bits and pieces of deployment information for Marines that did indeed deploy to laser strike, but I find this unlikely. In Wiggins testimony, and all the way back to his initial outreach to Steven Greer. On 1st August 2000, the young Lance corporal described Operation and laser strike extremely accurately, and the only detail that stands out as odd is how Jonathan claimed his USAF radar base was near the Bolivian border.

01:32:02:22 - 01:32:28:12
Unknown
I still maintain he likely meant Iquitos near the Colombian and Brazilian borders. Mach G 28 Marines from Jonathan's U.S. station, Cherry Point, North Carolina, did absolutely deploy the laser strike. This is a fact. I find it odd where it would not have deployed with the other Mach G 28 Marines for perimeter defense and low altitude aerial defense to replace the obsolete Hawk batteries, similar to hit pieces on David Grush.

01:32:28:12 - 01:32:55:14
Unknown
I also have a tremendous issue when claims of witnesses or whistleblowers are dismissed because of, quote unquote, health conditions. Jonathan has been plain. This incident affected his life extremely negatively, from the violent interrogation to feeling like non-human beings were calling out for his help in the craft wreckage. Jonathan did not leave this incident unscathed in the slightest. I must interject my own personal biases here, but I am close friends with Mr. Wigand.

01:32:55:18 - 01:33:11:23
Unknown
The man enjoys a successful career and relationships with friends, family and loved ones. As far as I can tell, the man does not suffer from fanciful delusions to construct such a specific fantasy.

01:33:12:01 - 01:33:38:03
Unknown
Since the witness testimony of Jake Barber, the concept of egg shaped UFO retrievals has grown significantly in popularity. While waking, it described a much larger, more intricate craft with hatches, a band of light along its circumference, and what seems similar to gills over Barber's SUV side. Smooth white egg. We can find multiple retrieval cases from history that share numerous similarities to the alleged crash in Peru in 1997.

01:33:38:03 - 01:34:09:04
Unknown
Let's reference the work done by legendary UFO crash retrieval researcher Leonard Stringfield and visit UFO Crash Retrieval Status Report three. Between 1980 and 1982, Stringfield became aware of one H.J., a sergeant in the U.S. Army 24th Infantry, who was wounded during service in the Korean War. In July of 1953, whilst a private and B company at Camp Polk, Louisiana, a 17 year old private H.J. in his unit under command of one Sergeant R.S., were performing duty maneuvers.

01:34:09:08 - 01:34:35:11
Unknown
At dusk at roughly 7 p.m., Hjs platoon observed an object that was egg shaped crash land out in the boondocks. According to H.J. authorities, as well as A and B companies were ordered out to the crash site. At the site, H.J. got within 15 yards of the object before Lieutenant Witting ordered company B to withdraw to 100 yards, stating quote unquote peons like H.J. quote had to get out of the way.

01:34:35:11 - 01:34:59:22
Unknown
End quote. Interestingly enough, we can place an actual lieutenant Witting at Camp Pollock. At this time, the area around the craft was badly burned, turning nearby ground into a powdery substance like crushed brick. And H.J. could still feel heat emanating from the vehicle. The craft was as wide as a three bedroom, single story ranch house, which by modern standard estimates, could be anywhere between 35 to 70ft.

01:35:00:00 - 01:35:27:21
Unknown
Similarities here exist to Wiggins craft estimates of 20m, or roughly 66ft. The large ovoid object was without windows or lights and was surrounded by a thin like protrusion on its equator, which was still rotating and, quote another close similarity to Wiggins and discussion of a band of light traveling across the craft circumference. Shortly after securing the site, a special detachment, medics, an ambulance and special equipment arrived on scene.

01:35:27:21 - 01:35:49:06
Unknown
This detachment approached an open hatch on the side of the craft. After a while, two medics carried away a stretcher to the ambulance containing a body. Three occupants of the craft then emerged and were aided by medics seemingly injured. H.J. would stay quote one of them kept looking at the one in the litter and made strange noises. I couldn't believe what I was seen and quote.

01:35:49:08 - 01:36:10:10
Unknown
As incredible as this detail is, we have discussed similar testimony before. Remember back to the infographics show whistleblower testimony of a crash retrieval operator. I put a lot of stock into the witness in this program. Claimed in several UFO retrieval operations in which craft were manned by Biologics Retrieval teams would often have to lead occupants out of the craft.

01:36:10:11 - 01:36:31:16
Unknown
These biologics were described seemingly as limited in cognitive ability, possibly giving some credence to the theory. Some UFO occupants are akin to biological androids that perform basic or specific functions that night. The two live ones apparently just kind of stood there as the team entered the craft. It had opened on its own. Maybe they opened the door. I don't know if it was open.

01:36:31:16 - 01:36:51:18
Unknown
When we got there. They stood there and they didn't answer the ambassador at all. Basically, they just barely reacted to anything, just basic stimuli like turning their heads away from bright lights. They didn't even object when the medical team started looking them over for injuries, or so I was told. I saw them when they were led out of the craft, and I do mean they were led out like children.

01:36:51:23 - 01:37:13:10
Unknown
The medical guys grabbed them by the hand and just let them out like a kid. They just sort of stood where you left them. H.J. described these occupants as three and a half to four feet tall of slight build, and walked as if they had no knees or very stiff, bending only at the hips. H.J. described the large head without features, leading him to believe the creatures were covered by a helmet.

01:37:13:10 - 01:37:43:15
Unknown
The biologics were a tight fitting, dull metallic green uniform. Later on, H.J. would somehow learn that these biologics were sent to a hospital and quote unquote, put into isolation. But all died in captivity. He also learned the corpses were sent over to a medical center near Washington, D.C. this could, of course, perhaps be the Army's Fort Detrick, roughly 40 miles away from D.C. at Fort Detrick, Battelle Memorial Institute manages the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasure Center for D.C..

01:37:43:19 - 01:38:11:01
Unknown
I have previously implicated Fort Detrick, alongside Utah's Dugway Proving Ground, in holding UFO biologics. I highly recommend checking out my video on Dugway to learn more. Hjs experience at Fort Polk shares striking similarities to Wage Gap. But let's go even further. Let's now jump to Springfield's 1991 UFO crash retrievals. The inner Sanctum Status Report six, and investigate the case of Barnabus, aka Albert Bruce Collins.

01:38:11:01 - 01:38:41:14
Unknown
Much of Springfield's work here came from UFO researcher Tim Cooper, one of the primary researchers who received significant drops of majestic 12 documents in the 1980s. Also recall from my majestic 12 project with author Ryan Wood how Tim Cooper's father, USAF Master Sergeant Harry B Cooper, received a special citation from the legendary general entwined in UFO lore. Courtesy LeMay this letter to Tim Cooper's father from LeMay praised Harry B Cooper for his work on the quote unquote, USAF UFO program.

01:38:41:19 - 01:39:11:05
Unknown
Anyways, Cooper interviewed Barnabus, aka Albert Bruce Collins, shortly before his 1990 New Year's Eve death on 20th November 1990. Collins claimed to be a metallurgical engineer and retired government employee, specifically developing metal alloys used for electromagnetic propagation and magnetic field propulsion. From 1942 to the late 1950s. And it is important to note, I can't necessarily confirm Collins claims of an accomplished metallurgical engineering career.

01:39:11:06 - 01:39:32:07
Unknown
While Collins did in fact die on 30th December 1990, all I can confirm from his obituary is he was a veteran, a member of the NRA and a Nature Conservancy. Collins disclosed to Cooper in 1947. He observed a UFO on a long flatbed trailer covered with a green tarp, being backed into a large warehouse at the University of California, Berkeley.

01:39:32:12 - 01:39:59:01
Unknown
I'm immediately reminded of U.S. Army lowboy trucks described in numerous UFO retrieval cases, such as the 1953 Kingman crash and the 1965 Kecksburg Pennsylvania crash. According to Collins, he stood but just 100ft away from an oval shaped craft described like an egg with the shell cracked in the yolk. Still inside, the craft was metallic, similar to polished aluminum, with a silvery looking finish similar to Wiggins case.

01:39:59:01 - 01:40:23:13
Unknown
This egg featured a seam at the edge all the way around. Collins guessed this craft suffered an internal explosion, with the metal exterior of the craft seemingly pushed out. The retrieval had sustained significant amounts of damage, with a large section ripped off and a huge gash on top running down the side below the seam from his 100ft away vantage point, Collins observed a bulkhead in front with multi-layered honeycomb skin.

01:40:23:13 - 01:40:50:07
Unknown
The interior was dark, but similar to the egg analogy. There was a shiny sphere in the center of the craft surrounded by another bulkhead. The craft additionally featured a forward compartment, but Collins could not see inside. The vehicle was 30 to 40ft in diameter and roughly 15ft high. These dimensions are slightly smaller than the craft which Ghantt described, but why even mention this short story of Collins, with no supporting documentation or even verification of his work?

01:40:50:07 - 01:41:16:01
Unknown
History as a metallurgical engineer? Well, this is because, in his 1990 interview with Tim Cooper, Collins additionally disclosed some information that may just raise your eyebrow. Not only did Collins claim to have studied metal of unknown composition and origin in an official capacity, but also claimed at this time, 1949, he learned of a multitude of agencies involved in t, uo or technologies of unknown origin research.

01:41:16:03 - 01:41:47:22
Unknown
This included intelligence officers from the U.S. Army, Air Force and Navy. The CIA, the Rand Corporation founded just one year prior in 1948, and the Vatican. Collins even claimed to have learned of multiple projects between these agencies Archangel, between the CIA, Rand and Vatican, Black Book under the Air Force, the infamous Blue Book under the Air Force White Book between the CIA and Vatican, and Yellow Book, which served as a scientific panel of an unknown government scientific review board.

01:41:48:00 - 01:42:15:19
Unknown
While discussing these projects, Collins added he had heard Los Alamos National Labs had been studying green fireballs and strange debris found in the desert. And this last piece of data is what lends credence to some of Collins words, as the Atomic Energy Commission did indeed create a Project twinkle in the late 40s and early 50s that analyzed UFOs, including green fireballs at Los Alamos, Sandia, White Sands and Holloman Air Force Base.

01:42:15:21 - 01:42:38:01
Unknown
Of course, this isn't our topic for today, but these joint projects with the Vatican are highly interesting. I have covered this case before, but let's briefly circle back to the 1933 magenta, Italy UFO crash retrieval case. According to the case, as well as David Grush in the late Harold Malmgren, Vatican intelligence alerted the United States of the lenticular disc in axis possession.

01:42:38:01 - 01:43:00:19
Unknown
This in turn allowed the U.S. to capture this UFO saucer post-World War Two. It's incredible to then consider joint U.S Vatican UFO programs that followed World War Two. Collins is quite the enigma, and possibly in the future we will return to analyze further claims of his included knowledge and Project Archangel that determined some UFO occupants were biological extraterrestrials.

01:43:01:01 - 01:43:28:10
Unknown
There are many cases of egg shaped or teardrop shaped UFO retrieval operations. We just don't have the time to cover today. I would also like to point to the 1973 Great Lake Naval Base r k testimony I covered in my previous naval UFO Legacy Programs project, in which gunnery school instructor R.K. observed a 30ft long and ten foot high teardrop shaped UFO resting on a wooden platform in a Quonset style hangar in the Great Lakes Naval Station, Illinois.

01:43:28:10 - 01:43:51:02
Unknown
This craft was allegedly shot down via a naval destroyer and picked up in the Pacific Ocean by the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office's Globemaster explorer. Hey guys, it's Gerb and I'd like to thank each and every single one of you for joining me on this very special investigation into Lance Corporal Jonathan Wiggin. Now, those of you new to my videos will now know one.

01:43:51:02 - 01:44:05:17
Unknown
This is an I. And two, this is where after the video, I kind of do an off script kind of rant. If you want to call in and give my thoughts on the video, give my thoughts on the investigation, and kind of summarize everything we've talked about, returning viewers of this channel will probably know this is a very special video.

01:44:05:19 - 01:44:27:01
Unknown
As one of my first ever projects was on Jonathan Wiggins. But of course at that time I didn't know Jonathan. I didn't have a relationship with him, nor did I have the investigative skills. The video editing skills, the research skills, the writing skills to craft such a project. Now, originally, the plan here was just to do an interview with Wiggins.

01:44:27:03 - 01:44:43:20
Unknown
And so after many months of knowing him and forming a friendship, I went out to where he resides. I'm not going to go ahead and spill that, but it's in the South, as you can probably tell from his accent, some of the other accents we heard, and I was fortunate enough to have my friend Kermit, Frog and Badger.

01:44:43:20 - 01:44:58:13
Unknown
I've had him on a live before, right after the November 14th, 2024 hearings, he was able to meet me out there and help film and so forth. So I want to give a huge shout out to him. Guys, he's a great friend of this channel. I'd like to have him on some more lives. He just on the drop of a pencil.

01:44:58:13 - 01:45:24:19

Decided to come up and help. So huge shout out. But this originally was planned to just be an interview with Wiggin. And as he and I started talking and as I started to sit with some of our conversations, I thought, well, maybe let's break this down a little bit and do a two part series. First. We get back in 2000, gave so much information, really actionable information, down to the dog team due to names.

01:45:24:19 - 01:45:44:19
Unknown
And you guys know on this channel how much we love when names are given and that in 2023 he offered a little new information. So I thought, why don't Jonathan and I sit down and really iron out some of the finer details of what he remembers? Because, guys, time is slipping away. This incident occurred, according to Jonathan in 1997.

01:45:44:19 - 01:46:10:03
Unknown
So we're pushing on 30 years here. But I wanted to get some of those details out and work out an investigation, and then sit down and do an interview with Jonathan. You guys know how I work. I really want the firm foundation laid out before he and I sit down and talk. So I do plan on returning with him and kind of getting a more relaxed interview style of him just speaking about his life, speaking about his life before and after and so forth.

01:46:10:03 - 01:46:30:23
Unknown
So that's that's going to be coming down the pipeline. But this project I thought it pertinent to to start digging into some of the details with Jonathan and then be able to do my own research and exploration. Some of these added details included Jonathan describing that the men in black kameez were there on site first. That was a huge question I had going into this weather.

01:46:31:01 - 01:46:53:05
Unknown
To kind of ponder if that team arrived on the stage 47 with the doughy nest, probably team, or that they had arrived first. Now, the fact they arrived first, according to Jonathan, gives even more credence to these were local special forces. Now, of course, he didn't describe seen any vehicles, but in my opinion, the seventh Army Green Berets probably utilized Humvees or nearby vehicles to arrive on scene.

01:46:53:05 - 01:47:21:17
Unknown
First. Another key point here was the multinational group that these Germans, these Chinese, they were all armed. Now that is a massive detail as well, and one that I'm still trying to to solve here, because of course, we've heard of multinational recovery teams specifically with Five Eyes Nations and Canadian politician Larry Maguire kind of writing to his own minister of defense in Canada, saying, we need to get information about UAP because of Five Eyes projects and maybe retrieval teams.

01:47:21:19 - 01:47:43:16
Unknown
And another huge detail he talked about was him thinking the men in black kameez were army due to the helmets they had. Now, if you're unfamiliar with military, various factions of military, army, Marines, Navy, all of their infantry and soldiers utilized different helmets. So being able to track down the helmets or kind of the caps they had, we thought these guys were army.

01:47:43:16 - 01:48:06:13
Unknown
And that's a huge detail to do to try and track down. I also really enjoyed him talking about mob gear and varying levels of that, and that gives even more credence to me for the ness team, varying levels of protection versus how close and proximity these men would get to the craft. Now, Jonathan's testimony is, of course, truly startling.

01:48:06:15 - 01:48:26:00
Unknown
One of the big questions remains now is what happened to the craft after? And Jonathan and I talked about this and I decided not to include it here because it's it's speculation with very little basis here. But that's a very interesting question to me. This craft was lodged into a granite cliff face almost. How was it taken out?

01:48:26:01 - 01:48:47:05
Unknown
How was it retrieved? Because if we're talking about seat 47 and The Night Stalker, sure, they may have airlifted some kind of picked apart Soviet helicopters before, but how do you get a craft of non-human origin, a massive one, and what are some of the logistics here? Were the biologics taken out? First? Was the rest of the liquid contain us and then taken out?

01:48:47:10 - 01:49:11:12
Unknown
And what went on here? And I do think one of the interesting parts of this story is the liquid. Now, as we dug into a Jonathan myself, he kind of theorized that, you know, maybe this liquid wasn't just a fuel or propulsion system, but he thought because some liquid was coming out of the recessed hole, the hatch that was open where he saw the biologic hanging out, that water was coming from there, that this craft may have been filled with water.

01:49:11:14 - 01:49:34:19
Unknown
And that brings up the question, what if the species he encountered were almost an aquatic species that lived in the water, and the craft contained almost an aquarium, or a closed system of water of sorts? I think these questions are highly interesting to ponder. I think one of the most fruitful and frustrating avenues of this research was reaching out to the fellow Marines, Adkins, Alan and Natalie Gray.

01:49:34:21 - 01:50:00:03
Unknown
Total. I probably reached out to ten people connected with laser strike only one responded to me and that was one of the Marines that we get claimed he was with. Now, it is important to note here all three of those Marines mortally gray, Alan and Adkins all went career USMC. They all retired, enlisted, but retired with very prestigious positions in the Marines.

01:50:00:03 - 01:50:21:06
Unknown
I'm not saying there's a connection there, but it is interesting to see that Jonathan kind of got made an example of and left the Marines in 98, admitted to using controlled substances so he could get out of the Marines. But these other guys enjoyed very long careers. Now, the one that responded to me again, I'm not going to burn his name just because I, you know, unlike Brad s in the flux liner, he hasn't sent me death threats.

01:50:21:06 - 01:50:42:08
Unknown
So I'm not going to burn his name or post any sort of, screenshots of messages. But I was a little displeased with how he treated Jonathan. I said in the video, and I'll say it again, I don't think that whistleblower testimony should be kind of boiled down to saying that the witness just has mental issues. I've seen it before.

01:50:42:08 - 01:51:07:18
Unknown
I'm sure we'll see it again. This reminds me to the team leader of Michael Herrera, Nathan, who just said that Michael was crazy because he enjoyed lifting weights and spending time alone whilst deployed, and I find arguments like that to be to not have much in him now. I would always find it weird when contacting this marine. Most of his story would go just towards the impossibility of USMC having Hawk batteries in Peru at that time, and I agree with that.

01:51:08:00 - 01:51:28:10
Unknown
Jonathan agrees with that, but he always said no, the story's false. The story can't be true because we didn't have Hawk batteries. The lance corporal story is false. So that's kind of a moot point to me. But I also think it's strange, he said, that Jonathan never deployed to Kalpa or to laser strike when Mach G 28 Marines very well indeed, according to our laser strike documentation, did deploy.

01:51:28:10 - 01:51:51:02
Unknown
So that's a bit of a curious point. Now, of course, I try and be as objective as I can in my videos, but in the end of my videos I tend to give my opinion. Guys, I do believe the encounter of Jonathan Wakan and I believe it for a couple reasons. Not just talking to Jonathan, but talking to kind of people not connected with this, I, I do have conviction that this case is real.

01:51:51:02 - 01:52:22:11
Unknown
I think it's one of the most extraordinary encounters of a downed UFO craft of all time. That being said, there's still mysteries here with this case, of course, time slipping away. So Jonathan is remembering fewer and fewer details, and I commend him for being able to say what he doesn't remember, because this was 30 years ago. And as impactful as such an event would be, there are going to be things he can't quite remember, like insignias on people's uniforms or tiny little details of the makeup of notches on the craft or the digits on an arm hanging out these things.

01:52:22:11 - 01:52:43:18
Unknown
I don't blame him for being able to recall, and I commend him for saying I'm speculating here or I don't recall when he doesn't know something. But I do think this is a case that did occur. What happened to the craft? We could only guess. Did it get taken to the Office of Naval Research because I suspect Namor to the naval, because I suspect Namor south had some sort of implications.

01:52:43:18 - 01:53:08:14
Unknown
Here was their transfer of materials or liquid up to Nambu up in Wright-Patterson. Who knows? Now, that being said, my theory of Mamoru and my theory of Iquitos and my theory of the seven, this does still need work. I think it's a strong thesis, but of course, we can't concretely prove this. The biggest take up here is, of course, Mamoru being the location where it was held versus him not receiving any medical treatment.

01:53:08:14 - 01:53:28:17
Unknown
I do think there's interest in that. The D.o.e. personnel probably nest. You know, I think at this point it's almost a moot point to to try and argue that it's not nest, but he was stripped of his clothes. Clearly his clothes were taken off as soon as he encountered the liquid, when he was beaten by the other Marines separated from Adkins and Alan.

01:53:28:17 - 01:53:45:09
Unknown
Who knows what happened to them? Who knows what happened to the seven plus other Marines that were not in the vanguard, that may have seen the craft, that may have not made it down the ridge? Wignot doesn't know, and he was put into isolation, threatened and so on. So I think because he took a swing at one of these men, he was both made an example of.

01:53:45:09 - 01:54:04:02
Unknown
And because he encountered the liquid, there was a contamination threat, but he didn't receive medical procedures. Is this a substance that the donor's team and retrieval teams are familiar with? And maybe it's just like a slightly acidic, goopy water with the consistency of sirup. So they weren't really worried, but they wanted to get those gloves off. And maybe.

01:54:04:04 - 01:54:21:19
Unknown
But that's all just speculation. So as Namor. But I do think that kind of fits the bill for, marine that came into contact with a non-human fluid. Get him isolated. But again, he said this location was underground. Perhaps Namor has underground facilities. Perhaps this was nearby. And I do think it's interesting. He was driven back to his base.

01:54:21:21 - 01:54:45:05
Unknown
Now I need to get in contact with somebody else stationed at detachment five, which I really have tried to see if there were 28 Marines there, because this would really solve quite a bit of this. But I do think it's interesting with the martial and training team and the special forces there and all of the history of special forces, whether that be the first 128th Aviation Regiment or the seventh Special Forces up there in northern Peru in history.

01:54:45:05 - 01:55:02:15
Unknown
Now, of course, this retrieval team could be a dedicated J soccer, former J soccer. So com retrieval team that stationed in South America maybe Howard Air Force Base in Panama, maybe somewhere else to react to these. This would fit in our time frame of retrieval too, because I know I gave about nine hours. It could be plus or minus an hour even to that, I have a lot of air here.

01:55:02:20 - 01:55:20:01
Unknown
They could be stationed for South American retrieval, so we just don't know. I'm just trying to work with the best available evidence we have and try and reconstruct the testimony. So of course, in my theory, there's a lot of assumptions there. And I was the first to say that there's a lot of assumptions. And if you have a competing theory of how this played out, please let me know.

01:55:20:01 - 01:55:32:07
Unknown
I'd love to hear it, because at the end of the day, I'm just trying to take some of the pieces of evidence and fit them into a theory. And I do think it's strong, but it is open to interpretation and probably open to error. So if you have something better there or something you think is stronger, let me know.

01:55:32:07 - 01:55:51:23
Unknown
I'd love to talk more about this case. Speaking of, let me know what you guys think in the comments, because I know so many people have wanted to hear more from way out and thrilled. This has some exclusive conversations with him for the first time, really. And since 2000, because on the Martin Willis Show, he he didn't really shed new light on any details.

01:55:52:01 - 01:56:07:23
Unknown
I almost get the sense he didn't quite want to be there. So I was really glad we get and I could form a friendship and then kind of sit down on camera together. And he was really nervous about being on camera. He doesn't like it. He's a very different person on camera versus not on camera. It makes him very uncomfortable.

01:56:07:23 - 01:56:26:09
Unknown
He's a very private guy, always has been. He was very animated in 2000 and he just it took him a lot to get over the fear of going on camera, then took him a lot of fear going on camera in 2023. And now. So with that being said, guys, this about the time I tell everybody, of course I do have a Patreon.

Please do that. Leave a comment that helps the channel out tremendously. These investigations take quite a while as as we found out here with about a week extra over my normal timetable of when I release video. So please support the channel however you can. And I got some great stuff coming down the pipeline, some active stuff. Whenever there's hearings, if those happen and whenever there's large events, you bet.

01:57:08:09 - 01:57:28:02
Unknown
I will be there. And you bet I will do a live covering them because I do not just want to be an armchair investigator. I want to get boots on the ground and do what I can to help this subject and help push for some semblance of disclosure. So again, guys, like and subscribe. If you want to support the Patreon, leave a comment, let me know what you think below and I will catch everybody on the next episode.
