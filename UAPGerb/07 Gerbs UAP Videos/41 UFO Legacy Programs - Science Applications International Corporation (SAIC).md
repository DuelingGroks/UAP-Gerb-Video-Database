Before the first soldier sets foot on the battlefield. Before the first recon flight takes off. Six there, helping the Army and Air Force transform opportunities into solutions for diverse missions, from mission command capabilities to enterprise. Its systems and modeling, simulation, and training. We work side by side with our customers to develop, field, and sustain critical capabilities for our mission soldiers and airmen.

00;00;33;08 - 00;00;41;06
Unknown
SAIC focused on mission success.

00;00;41;08 - 00;01;10;04
Unknown
Well, that's one of those big Pentagon contractors. Those of us who believe there is UFO information and craft and materials stashed suspect that SAIC would be one of the likely candidates to get that stuff. It's right in the heart of the larger conspiracy law. Our impact. I think that was the testimony. This is an alien reproduction vehicle. And just to be clear, this means that it is based on advanced anti-gravity and zero point energy propulsion systems.

00;01;10;04 - 00;01;47;05
Unknown
Those are the propulsion systems. They are being manufactured by a consortium of companies that include Lockheed Martin, Northrop, SAIC, and other corporations. James Defense Weekly, the popular military defense publication published an article about the SAIC and the postscript to the article that anyone who believes in the science of anti-gravity to be too arcane, too esoteric, even for the US Air Force, should consider the Electric Propulsion Study undertaken by SAIC for the Astronautics Laboratory, which is now part of the Phillips lab.

00;01;47;12 - 00;02;20;29
Unknown
The study's primary objective was to outline physical methods to test theories of inductive coupling between electromagnetic and gravitational forces, to determine the feasibility of such methods, as they apply to space propulsion, and, in simplified terms, and anti-gravity propulsion system that remains, for some, the ultimate quantum leap. On this channel, I have discussed numerous DoD contractors and federally funded research and development centers with strong ties and paper trails to UFO crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs.

00;02;21;01 - 00;02;51;20
Unknown
After all the research conducted by myself and scores of other researchers over the decades have, on countless occasions, directly accused the U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence community of working in tandem with defense contractors for disease and youth to reverse engineer exotic technologies of unknown origin, protected by special access and unacknowledged special access programs. Overall, you know, the government has been the custodian of a lot of this, right?

00;02;51;20 - 00;03;40;27
Unknown
And the old, old had receded out to, clear defense contractor to do some analysis, which I find highly unethical. You have basically a sole source arrangement, and you allow certain, private corporate elements, to look at this, develop a potential insight, and then sell it back to the government for profit. And I think that's, totally unethical, whether this be Northrop Grumman in of legacy programs under the taken radar site, under Antelope Valley, Lockheed Martin, and accusations of constructing the TR three B reverse engineered alien Reproduction vehicle, Battelle Memorial Institute, and declassified studies of shape memory alloys possibly originating from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash, or the Aerospace Corporation and Mater Corporation,

00;03;40;27 - 00;04;12;13

both founded between 1959 to 1960, allegedly to exploit technologies of unknown origin. Much of our work on this channel is spent analyzing the private or semi-private sectors. Today, I want to dive back into the corporate world to cover an enormous DoD contractor and defense and technology corporation that I believe may, in fact, be even more intimately entwined with UFO legacy program operations and security over any other American defense contractor.

00;04;12;15 - 00;04;45;07
Unknown
Science Applications International Corporation. Many viewing this video will recognize SAIC, as we will call it, from here on out, as a usual tricky customer of this channel. No longer a piece of lost media. Back on 17th July 2024, long before his excellent interview on Jesse Michaels, I relayed the testimony of former U.S. Army Green Beret Randy Anderson and accused SAIC as the contractor running the off World Technologies Division beneath a Naval Surface Warfare Center crane in Indiana.

00;04;45;12 - 00;05;20;24
Unknown
Today, I'm happy to announce I will be rereleasing that investigation. And while I highly recommend viewing that research in its entirety, the first time Randy spoke publicly about his encounter, we will cover his story again today in briefer detail. The trail of SAIC and UFO legacy programs is not as clear cut and glamorous as any contractor or FDC we have covered before on this channel, but by studying SAIC, I strongly believe we gain invaluable insights into UFO legacy, program funding, infrastructure, modus operandi, secrecy, and more.

00;05;20;26 - 00;05;49;01
Unknown
So for this investigation, we will break up our research into five main areas of study Black Budget, Money's Legacy Program, gatekeeping, Sci research, technologies of unknown origin, and material craft housing. At the end of this investigation, we should be able to make sense of some interesting questions, such as what should we make of Doctor Sean Kirkpatrick's former position as senior research scientist for SAIC in 2000?

00;05;49;02 - 00;06;21;11
Unknown
Pre-Roe. What can we learn from former SAIC employee Denise McKinsey, who discussed abuse of funds on enormous defense contracts? Why has SAIC historically conducted endless advanced propulsion and human psychic research? And does SAIC really run divisions storing non-human artifacts below some of the United States premier weapons centers? Hey guys, it's UAP! Gaurav and I am thrilled for you to join me today as we investigate Washington shadow the Pentagon's body shop.

00;06;21;15 - 00;06;52;05
Unknown
Science applications International corporations, and their involvement in UFO legacy program operations, often called the NSA West. I believe SAIC and their decades of cutting edge, compartmentalized science and technology contracts, as well as intimate ties with senior DoD and intelligence community personnel, highlight a contractor entrenched in UFO legacy programs at the highest level.

00;06;52;07 - 00;07;22;10
Unknown
SAIC is a bit of a black box. Much of what it does is proprietary or even top secret, so it's hard to tell whether what SAIC provides is necessary and effective to understand SAIC and its corporate structure. That lends perfectly to an institution entwined with U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence community deep Sixed black budget special access programs, we must first step back and analyze the history of SAIC science.

00;07;22;10 - 00;07;50;00

Applications. Was born in 1969 from doctor J. Robert based or based or served in the US Navy during World War Two before earning his Ph.D. in nuclear physics in 1950. The doctor skills were immediately put to work for the Westinghouse Atomic Power Division on the nuclear submarine program. Based tours would then join Los Alamos National Labs as a research physicist, before joining General Atomics as the chair of the accelerator Physics Department.

00;07;50;04 - 00;08;20;12

Quote I was not the brilliant flash of inspiration, type of entrepreneur and quote based or would state. Rather, he was more of a quote unquote persistent builder type. Come 3rd February 1969, Baxter would start SAIC immediately stacking the company with General Atomics scientist and created one of the first employee owned companies. He made it a priority to ensure that every employee owned a part of the new company, even using employee ownership as a recruiting and retention tool.

00;08;20;14 - 00;08;46;01
Unknown
Staff were expected to perform superior scientific and technical work, while also playing a key role in the management and direction of the company. Six internal stock ownership program, which promised to make government officials rich after they left public service, allowed Baxter to immediately pack the payroll with specialist and subject matter experts, but also with generals, diplomats, spies and cabinet officers.

00;08;46;07 - 00;09;20;14
Unknown
Sykes board and high level workforce was, from the company's inception, staffed with high level military and intelligence personnel with unprecedented access to lucrative contracts and special access programs. Quote, they had better access to the Pentagon than the government's own attorneys and, quote, some of these acquisitions included the illustrious Bobby Ray Inman, Navy admiral, NSA director and CIA Deputy Director John M Deutch, Undersecretary of defense under President Jimmy Carter and CIA director under president Bill Clinton.

00;09;20;21 - 00;09;47;29
Unknown
Rear Admiral William F Raybon, who headed development of the Polaris submarine program, and many, many, many more personnel. We will address all of these figures and more, such as Doctor Sean Kirkpatrick in our CIC gatekeeper section. Indeed, six ventures were so successful out of the gate. Baxter's very first government contracts came from the Defense Atomic Support Agency, where the company was tasked with calculating the output of nuclear devices.

00;09;47;29 - 00;10;35;15
Unknown
By the mid 2000, SAIC achieved unrivaled success in government science and technology contracting, specializing, as Vanity Fair once said in 2007, as a quote, body shop in the brain business, it sells human beings who have a particular expertise expertise about weapons, about homeland security, about surveillance, about computer systems, about information dominance and information warfare. End quote. By 2007, SAIC and its two major offices in San Diego, California and Washington, DC ballooned to the size of an entire government agency, featuring a workforce of over 44,000 larger than the manpower of the Departments of Labor, energy and Housing and Urban Development combined at that time.

00;10;35;18 - 00;11;22;10
Unknown
Current day outside of their major offices, SAIC maintains countless locations across the continental United States, many of which are near US military installations or are DTA facilities such as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, Indiana, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, China Lake Naval Air Station, California, Sandia National Labs, New Mexico, and Crystal city, Virginia, similar to Northrop Grumman and their acquisition of contractors such as TRW and Teledyne Ryan, and connections to federally funded research and development centers such as the Aerospace Corporation SAIC exhibits a similar intriguing history of acquisitions, mergers, associate ations, etc. one such corporation allegedly spun from SAIC is DSA.

00;11;22;10 - 00;12;17;11
Unknown
I decision Science Applications, Inc., founded in Virginia on 4th January 1977, DSI operated as an employee owned technical services company with expertise in military command and control systems, commercial information management systems, software development, electrical engineering, telecommunications and physics, and quote. According to some previous whistleblowers such as the controversial Colonel Steve Wilson, DSI and SAIC were one in the same, with DSI featuring a board consisting of the directors of relevant UFO black budget divisions including IBM, Lockheed, Teledyne, Ryan, Aerojet, Electro Systems, etc. Wilson would also claim Bobby Ray Inman, a reoccurring figure on this channel and member of the Board of Directors of SAIC, also ran DSI to learn more about Wilson.

00;12;17;11 - 00;13;00;29
Unknown
I do recommend checking out my video on Northrop Grumman and UFO Legacy Program operations. I will not waste much time here by reviewing his whistleblower claims. Again, let's still briefly mention a handful of Wilson's claims and why he is relevant to today's project. Wilson would disclose to Doctor Richard Boylan a UFO researcher with many publications. I approach with skepticism that he, Wilson, was not only stationed at area 51, S-4 would reverse engineer two anti-gravity vehicles were tested, but that he also spearheaded Project Pounds, an elite Air Force National Reconnaissance Organization Special Forces unit, which retrieved downed UFOs with elements of Jayhawk, specifically Delta Force.

00;13;00;29 - 00;13;29;25
Unknown
Project pounds can be observed in the disputed majestic 12 Project Aquarius document, and oddly enough, the 1953 Robertson Panel report. Remember, the Robertson Panel served as a debunking panel to reduce public concern regarding UFOs. Wilson would claim the first successful flight of manmade anti-gravity alien reproduction vehicles had occurred on 18th July 1971, which saw Admiral Bobby Ray Inman present for the test.

00;13;29;25 - 00;13;55;18
Unknown
Inman, still at the Navy at this time, would go on to serve as the director of the NSA, Deputy director of the CIA, Vice director of the CIA, Director of Naval Intelligence, and board member of SAIC. In the 1980s, Wilson's disclosures are indeed intriguing, but should, of course, be taken with some skepticism. Therefore, I do recommend also reading a more skeptical take on Wilson written by Kevin Randall.

00;13;55;21 - 00;14;48;00
Unknown
But relevant to our discussion is Wilson's map of Star Wars City, an illustration depicting UFO legacy program operations conducted covertly within the Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as SDI. Created in 1983 under President Ronald Reagan. This SDI program will be discussed again in our project in much greater detail, so please hang tight. Within this chart are numerous institutions one might expect to be associated with UFO retrieval and exploitation programs the NRO, the National Security Council, the National Security Agency, CIA, nor add in a majestic 12 adhering to the SDI Colorado HQ in Madurai, there exists a list of contractors alleged to engage with the UFO portfolio alongside the 1010 Special Security Squadron, which, quote, provides

00;14;48;00 - 00;15;19;00
Unknown
a high level of protection to nor add us Space.com and AF Space.com resources. Located at the mountain end. Quote. Contractors such as Rockwell, Martin, Marietta, Lockheed, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and IBM are mentioned. Wilson would state one contractor of Paramount to the SDI UFO programs was Decision Science Applications, Inc., but here is where things get really interesting. We don't have concrete evidence DSI was spawned from SAIC, though it is likely.

00;15;19;00 - 00;15;44;06
Unknown
However, we can analyze the evolution of DSI, and I would like to thank Reddit user Still Chil Trill for this incredible work. His account is now deleted, but I will still link to his excellent posts. In 1998, DSI executed a merger into a company called DSR acquisitions, Inc. that was then purchased by Steven Myers and Associates for almost $31 million in cash and stock.

00;15;44;13 - 00;16;21;19
Unknown
By 21st August of that year, Steven Myers and Associates finalized their acquisition of DSI, DSR. Steven Myers and Associates eventually acquired Emergent Information Technologies, Inc. and SMD. A changed its name to Emergent Information Technologies on 6th December 2001, Emergent Information Technologies sold its Virginia based government Services group to L3 communications. L3 Harris, formerly known as L3 communications, is another defense contractor that has both worked alongside SAIC for enormous defense contracts and as a contractor.

00;16;21;19 - 00;16;57;15
Unknown
I have been informed, works directly in UFO legacy program operations. But to fully complete the circle in July of 2012, a part of L3 communications, aka L3, Harris spun off into its own publicly traded company called and Gelati. In 2018, CIC purchased Engine City for $2.5 billion, so regardless of if DSI was spawned from SAIC, eventually DSI assets made their way to SAIC and another defense contractor, highly likely involved in UFO legacy operations, L3 Harris.

00;16;57;17 - 00;17;27;06
Unknown
But if that wasn't already difficult enough to track, incredibly convoluted corporate structures are commonplace with SAIC. On 27th September 2013, SAIC created a $4 billion spin off, retaining the name SAIC while transforming its name to Lados. The primary reason for this spinoff was, quote, conflicts of interest provisions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which prevented the company from bidding on some new contracts because of existing contracts, end quote.

00;17;27;06 - 00;17;53;24
Unknown
So essentially, SAIC had so many contracts and was so big, it had to split up to gain more. So just to point out, when I refer to SAIC, I'm referring to both SAIC and Lados, but this gets even more interesting on 16th August 2016, Lados merged with Lockheed Martin Information Systems, Inc. Global Solutions that saw Lados acquire this Lockheed division for $5 billion.

00;17;53;24 - 00;18;23;24
Unknown
And in an additional interesting event, on 30th November 2017, Lockheed Martin Services, Inc. changed their name to Leidos Government Services, Inc. After the creation of Letos, SAIC announced acquisition of Skitter Holdings, a defense and space manufacturing contractor with specific expertise in intelligence, for $790 million. This purchase was completed in an all cash transaction and retain the majority of original skitter employees.

00;18;23;24 - 00;18;49;25
Unknown
According to a 2008 book spies for Intelligence by Tim Shorrock, Ski tours was a critical contractor for the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology for satellite signals intelligence and electronic intelligence. The CIA Directorate of Science and Technology, or DST, is a commonplace subject on this channel, serving as a legacy UFO program office that in 2002 spawned the CIA Office of Global Access.

00;18;49;27 - 00;19;26;13
Unknown
Excellent journalist Chris Sharp, myself, and others have accused the Office of Global Access, or Oga, as participating in foreign UFO crash retrieval operations. I have. Additionally, when discussing U.S. Navy UFO foreign material acquisition and exploitation programs, discussed the CIA, DSA alongside NRO, Nuro, so. Com, Department of Energy and more operating worldwide undersea UFO retrieval operations. I have quite a few projects to learn more about the CIA, and so go check out any of these projects in the video description.

00;19;26;19 - 00;19;50;23
Unknown
Perhaps SAIC took note of Skeeter for their expertise in mass or measurement and signals intelligence, a highly classified form of intelligence quote, that uses infrared heat imaging, acoustic signatures, seismic data, and other information picked up by air and ground sensors to sniff out for weapons tests and other activities that other countries want to hide from the United States and quote.

00;19;50;29 - 00;20;30;17
Unknown
Nascent collection is primarily managed by the CIA and used extensively by the CIA. In 2005, Ski Tours held a national symposium on nascent signature technology with contractors involved such as Boogie Systems and, of course, SAIC. After all, according to spies for hire, quote, ski tours may be unknown, but it is definitely not a small player. End quote. Also, consider me curious and possibly suspicious that ski tours old building enchant til Virginia 14660 Lee road, to be specific, resides in the same corporate park with SAIC, the Aerospace Corporation and FTC.

00;20;30;17 - 00;20;57;08
Unknown
I have accused directly as having decades of UFO program involvement in the NRO. Sykes acquisitions and partnerships are indeed indicative of a contractor entwined with UFO legacy program operations. Later in this project, we will explore this even further, such as Sykes relationship with e.g., the contractor Bob Lazar claimed hired him to reverse engineer UFO propulsion systems at area 51 S for.

00;20;57;10 - 00;21;32;27
Unknown
Equally intriguing as Sykes acquisitions are the corporations intimate ties with U.S. intelligence and knack for war profiteering. From its inception, SAIC enjoyed high level former intelligence officials on its board, but I would also like to reference a 2018 Baltimore Sun article titled Little known Contractor Has Close Ties with staff of NSA. This article, along with the excellent book The Shadow Factory by James Bamford, detail how SAIC basically became, quote unquote, NSA West, a revolving door between the NSA and SAIC.

00;21;32;27 - 00;22;00;14
Unknown
Interesting here, as the National Security Agency, or NSA, is one of the US's big five intelligence agencies, alongside the NRO, CIA, Dia, NCA, NRO, and likely the hidden neuro in numerous programs. I have implicated the NSA in UFO legacy program operations from enforcing gatekeeping in the form of Treat or the Tactical Reconnaissance Engineering Assessment Team to management of RV programs such as the TR3.

00;22;00;14 - 00;22;22;26
Unknown
B as a side note, an unnamed retired Army public affairs officer friend of mine who brushed up against legacy programs told me he was not frightened by the CIA, but was terrified of the behemoth that was the NSA. And later on, we will discuss possible avenues of black budget moneys conducted between SAIC and the NSA. So hold tight.

00;22;23;02 - 00;22;52;07
Unknown
Keep in mind during our investigation that SAIC is an eligible contractor under the DoD Corporate Portfolio Program. The Corporate Portfolio program gives defense industrial based corporations like SAIC access to D.O.D. executives, scientists, and management with broad access to special access programs. The Corporate Portfolio Program Framework was established in 2020 under then U.S. Undersecretary for defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Ellen Lord.

00;22;52;11 - 00;23;22;19
Unknown
In an almost comical sequence of events, Lord would join six advisory Board in July 2021, and as we progress in this investigation, I find it prudent to mention SAIC is accustomed to getting their way, however, and whenever they want, whether this be in the form of acquisition, enormous sole source contracts or war profiteering efforts, many viewers on this channel are familiar with the cries of weapons of mass destruction that fueled the logic behind the Iraq war.

00;23;22;24 - 00;23;50;10
Unknown
Now, did you know SAIC executives were involved at every stage of the Iraq war lifecycle? Indeed, SAIC personnel were instrumental in pressing the case that weapons of mass destruction existed in Iraq in the first place, and that the war was the only way to get rid of them. And when no weapons of mass destruction were found, SAIC personnel staffed the commission that was set up to investigate how American intelligence could have been so disastrous.

00;23;50;13 - 00;24;19;17
Unknown
Wrong end quote. Just to provide some further context here, in 1998, David Key, weapons expert and director of SAIC center for counterterrorism Technology and analyzes, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Saddam Hussein, quote, remains in power with weapons of mass destruction and, quote, following the Iraq War, President Bush appointed a commission to analyze how American intelligence managed to, quote, miss the truth about Iraq's weapons programs.

00;24;19;17 - 00;24;50;23
Unknown
End quote. The commission published a report just one year later absolving policymakers and U.S. intelligence from distorting evidence of Iraq's WMDs. The commission had direct ties to SAIC, including Gordon Uhler, SAIC VP for Corporate Development, Jeffrey R Cooper, VP for technology and chief science officer of one of six major subunits. And Samuel S Wisner, SAIC VP and director of strategic Planning and business development for Sykes Intelligence Group.

00;24;50;23 - 00;25;02;08
Unknown
And now that we have finally set the stage for SAIC and UFO legacy programs, let's begin to dive in.

00;25;02;11 - 00;25;33;00
Unknown
You can say categorically you've seen no convincing FCC confirmable evidence and intact spacecraft kept by the US government. No, I have seen nothing. That leads me to that conclusion. Is it possible there is some secret program that you're just not aware of? I don't think so. I have access to anything and everything I need. And the way you combat conspiracy theories and and the associated misunderstandings that fuel them, it is it's fact and science and truth.

00;25;33;00 - 00;26;00;29
Unknown
So if you've got evidence for a conspiracy, then then that helps to investigate what the underlying truth is. There has been nothing that has been substantiated to this and every thing that has been brought to our attention and everything that was brought to my attention when I was in that position as the director, we investigated and discovered that it did not come from where they thought it came from.

00;26;01;05 - 00;26;33;20
Unknown
Most everything was explainable through other documentation, other programs, other people that had talked to other people Washington, shadow, NSA, West, whatever you want to call it. SAIC has served as a revolving door for high level U.S. Department of Defense personnel since the company's inception. SAIC was aggressively packed with, quote, former generals, admirals, diplomats, spies and cabinet officers of every kind to fill the company's board of directors and the upper echelons of its staff.

00;26;33;20 - 00;26;57;26
Unknown
And with such high level staff, it is no surprise there are numerous accused, high level gatekeepers to UFO legacy programs with aggressive and shocking ties to SAIC. Let's reflect on Doctor Sean Kirkpatrick, former head of the Pentagon's all Domain Anomaly Resolution office. I certainly hold no love for Kirkpatrick, and I wager many viewers of this channel share the same sentiment.

00;26;57;28 - 00;27;33;14
Unknown
When I was in USDA, I read the transcripts of Sean Patrick, briefing Senator Rubio, Senator Warren, and Senator Gillibrand on the results of his investigation in his congressionally tasked Ero report. And those transcripts, which were supposed to be, open kimono, here's the truth, Mr.. Senator. Mr.. Senator, Sean Kirkpatrick absolutely distorted, downplay and I can't prove it, but I would say outright lied to to the people who have direct responsibility for him saying what what what did he say?

00;27;33;14 - 00;27;55;02
Unknown
There was a lot. So it's more of a lie of the whole thing. Picture the big picture right in in the meeting. It's, you know, oh, we you know, Congressman Rubio, you know, we've we've heard about this incident, we just don't have enough data to go on it to really know what this is. We don't have any way of really figuring out what's going on.

00;27;55;22 - 00;28;24;28
Unknown
It could just be an anomaly. In fact, it's most likely anomaly. So starting with an acknowledgment that, you know, here you. Oh, yeah, you have some data, but we have the insight and the scientific expertise to make you feel at ease. Nothing to see here, folks. Exactly. Although there was also political discussion involved in historic discussion. And, you know, I read these transcripts once, and immediately knew that.

00;28;27;13 - 00;29;05;05
Unknown
Yeah. Veiled threat. No, I, I knew that I was now at something else I was in I had inside knowledge into the deception of our government by elements of our intelligence community. Under Kirkpatrick, Aero released the abysmal Aero Historical Report, volume one, which outright lied about some witness testimony. This was proven, for example, by Michael Herrera's official aero memorandum for record, which showed Herrera did not claim to encounter an extraterrestrial spaceship or U.S Special Forces as falsely outlined in the Aero report Aero under the direction of Doctor Kirkpatrick.

00;29;05;05 - 00;29;33;20
Unknown
Additionally, in 2022, engaged in DoD contracts with contractors Sand Corp., a company with a specialty in plugging whistleblower leaks. I have also in the past shown ties with Kirkpatrick and his good buddy Ronald Moultrie, former undersecretary of defense for Intelligence and Security and board member of both Battelle Memorial Institute and the Miter Corporation, and how Kirkpatrick and Moultrie enjoyed debunking claims of UFOs at previous Aero roundtables.

00;29;33;26 - 00;29;59;13
Unknown
The guy that formed, Aero. But upon whose recommendation Aero was formed, is a guy named Ed Moultrie, who is undersecretary of defense for intelligence. And he was on Battelle board, and he scrubbed that from his LinkedIn. And my good friend, UAP group, who is an amazing channel, super deep UFO researcher, showed that this was it was on his resume.

00;29;59;14 - 00;30;21;09
Unknown
And then he recommends that aero for him. It's like the total conflict of interest. Insane. It's insane. Kirkpatrick, during his time at Aero and Post, Aero, has frequently engaged in dismissing any and all whistleblower claims, often resorting to emotionally charged outbursts. You believe them? I believe that they believe what they're telling me, and I my job is not to.

It's not a question of belief, right? It's a question of what? Can I go research? There is absolutely nothing that I'm going to do, say or produce evidentiary that is going to make the true believers convert, if you will. I mean, it's almost like a religion. It is basically a religion. Myself and others have wagered Kirkpatrick served and possibly still serves as a gatekeeper for UFO legacy programs.

This sentiment was shared by witness Ed, the four 12th test Wing who refused to testify to arrow under Kirkpatrick, as, according to Ed Kirkpatrick, is an insider meant to squash information. The doctors employment history, pre and post arrow is additionally intriguing. The good doctor has filed many patents, including 2022 and 2023 patents for quote system and methods for determining influence of channels in a social network.

No, instead, it is Sean Kirkpatrick's former patents with SAIC, including a 2003 filing for, quote, holographic recording and micro nanofabrication via ultrafast holographic two photon induced photo polymerization HTP IP end quote. Between joining the NRO and CIA in 2003, in 2005, respectively, and working within the Air Force Research Laboratory in 1997, Kirkpatrick worked at SAIC as a senior research scientist.

We can specifically review work for SAIC as a senior research scientist in the year 2000. Now, how interesting is that? A senior SAIC scientist went on to spearhead a questionable office in arrow that was originally supposed to be called the UAP. JPL, which some have called Project Blue Book 2.0 now. Flashback to 1987 SAIC had previously conducted some of Sean Kirkpatrick's favorite type of science for the doughy aspects of turbulence in nonlinear solutions.

Shortly after leaving both the Pentagon and Arrow, Kirkpatrick began his own LLC called Nonlinear Solutions. As of 1st January 2025, Nonlinear Solutions has been subcontracted by the major corporation, an FDC. I have spoken about ad nauseam on this channel for DoD indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts for U.S. space. Com the description of this miter contract reads.

I commonly connect to UFO programs. After his tenure as the DoD mouthpiece to debunk UFO information with arrow, let us now transition to the most legendary testimony of gatekeeping UFO legacy programs in history the Wilson Davis Memo. Now, in this video, in the interest of time, I will assume the viewer has some knowledge of the Wilson Davis meeting notes.

00;34;52;09 - 00;35;15;11
Unknown
So if you don't go check out my first ever video on this channel. It's a little rough, but still gets the message across. In short, these disputed but highly likely accurate notes transcribed by Doctor Eric Davis, leaked from the estate of the late astronaut Edgar Mitchell. These notes recount a 2002 conversation between Davis and Vice Admiral and former CIA director Thomas Wilson.

00;35;15;11 - 00;35;56;23
Unknown
Outside of the parking lot of contractor EVGA in Nevada. The conversation recounts Wilson finding but being stonewalled in accessing UFO recovery and material exploitation programs protected by the DoD Special Access Program Oversight Committee, SAP Hoc Senior Review Group, SG, and a large defense contractor, I wager, might in fact be SAIC. According to Wilson, he was informed by General Michael Ward to search a special records group in the office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, belonging to special legacy holdover programs from before special access program restructuring efforts in the early 1990s.

00;35;57;00 - 00;36;24;17
Unknown
In the memo, UFO programs were reorganized under SAP s SG after an internal audit almost revealed the program's. This SAP OC reorganization began on 5th January 1994, when the Deputy Secretary of Defense significantly enhanced and strengthened changes in the DoD Special Access Program. SAP management and control structure. This newsletter on screen now highlights those changes. Establishing the Senior Review Group.

00;36;24;20 - 00;37;11;13
Unknown
We can also possibly find some useful data in the Gallo's May 1993 report titled DoD Special Access Programs Administrative Due Process not Provided when Access is denied or Revoked, end quote, which discusses the Navy and Air Force not complying with DoD regulations. 6200.2/R, which discussed special access program access. I did find it interesting that between the Army, Air Force and Navy, it was in fact the Army that did comply in some cases for SAP regulations, according to this Gao document, and according to some of my research, this makes sense to me as well as I am familiar with cases in which the US Army seemed to operate UFO material exploitation programs in a strict, controlled

00;37;11;13 - 00;37;38;14
Unknown
environment with oversight, while Navy and Air Force legacy programs seemed to operate far more loosely and out of control. But let's take a deeper look at the sap OC in its Senior Review group that was upon its creation by the Deputy Secretary of Defense tasked with gatekeeping UFO legacy programs, according to VA ADM Wilson, around the time of this restructuring, the SAP org was chaired by Deputy Secretary of Defense the Honorable John Deutch.

00;37;38;21 - 00;38;01;28
Unknown
Mind you, John Deutch did not restructure sap OC as dep secdef this was conducted by his predecessor, William Perry, but Deutch immediately followed suit in the role. Immediately prior his position chairing SAP, OLC as the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Deutch served as the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology. The same office Wilson learned contained UFO legacy files.

00;38;02;01 - 00;38;33;06
Unknown
Now, Deutch here is very interesting. Based upon the testimony of VA ADM Wilson, we can conclude with a high degree of certainty. Deutch served as a gatekeeper for UFO legacy programs. Deutch served as a Director of Central Intelligence, a professor at MIT, enjoyed numerous positions within the DoD, and also served as a consultant pre work on sabacc with TRW, Los Alamos National Labs, and Miter, three institutions I directly accused of being involved in UFO programs, but that's not all.

00;38;33;11 - 00;39;04;09
Unknown
Pre 1995, possibly during his tenure as DEP Secdef and within the House that Deutch served as the director of SAIC and even worked in six La Hoya office, the same office of Denise McKenzie. So here's what we're left with. According to Wilson, the reorganization of SAP, OC and creation of the Senior Review Group directly served to gatekeeper UFO legacy programs from even a three star admiral and Dia director, DEP Secdef William J.

00;39;04;09 - 00;39;29;12
Unknown
Perry conducted such a reorganization in February of 1994, and immediately one month after a new DEP secdef is assigned and put in charge as chairman of SAP OC, this being a former SAIC director. But that's not all to put the real cherry on top here. Even William J. Perry himself, who reorganized SAP back in 1994, once served on the board of SAIC.

00;39;29;18 - 00;39;56;20
Unknown
One could be chance. Two is a pattern, so let's extend this further. During his investigations, Vice Admiral Wilson spoke to two permanent members of the Special Access Program Oversight Committee, Brigadier General Mike Costa, Nick and Paul Kaminsky, the undersecretary of defense for Acquisition and Technology, preceded by Deutch Kaminsky and Permanent Senior Review Group member Alan Wells, are both lifelong Miter Corporation members, but I digress.

00;39;56;20 - 00;40;21;05
Unknown
A permanent sap OC member post SAP restructuring is Admiral William A Owens, former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Outside of his prestigious naval career and service as senior military assistant to Dick Cheney, Owens additionally served as the CEO for SAIC. All in all, the sap OC, which was restructured in the early 1990s to serve as a gatekeeping structure for UFO legacy programs.

00;40;21;05 - 00;40;46;09
Unknown
According to Wilson, saw two of six personnel as former SAIC alumni. This is why I wager the contractor Wilson, accused us operating alongside the SAP SSG for UFO secrecy is in fact SAIC. And let's not forget a critical third man mentioned in the Wilson Davis notes, naval Reserve Commander Willard Miller Miller attended the 1997 meeting with ADM Wilson and Steven Greer.

00;40;46;09 - 00;41;16;24
Unknown
And yes, this meeting did take place. This is a fact. During this meeting in the parking lot between Davis and Wilson, Davis flashed a 2002 letter addressed to him from Commander Miller. Within the letter, Miller offered to aide Davis and physicist Hal put off and their UFO crash retrieval research. Miller requested anonymity. Clearly, this wasn't honored, but offered to connect the men to multiple high value targets and information, including a senior official with knowledge on alien reproduction vehicles.

A list of civilian DoD contractors involved in UFO crash retrieval and material exploitation programs in a team possibly involved with UFO crash retrievals. Where did Miller get this Intel? Was it firsthand experience, exposure to programs or connections in the corporate world? Because Miller did, after all, work as a, quote, senior analyst in future counter threat planning directed energy weapons, space systems and Navy space wargaming and quote for SAIC.

00;41;46;17 - 00;42;12;17
Unknown
Indeed, in a 2000 book called Swamp Gas Times, my two decades on the UFO Beat by Patrick Q, emails between Commander Miller and Attorney Peter Gersten are detailed. Miller believed, quote, senior government officials such as the director of the CIA, with whom I met with recently on the subject, are protected and isolated from knowledge of this subject and from data gathered by their own Department of Defense intelligence organizations.

00;42;12;23 - 00;42;44;12
Unknown
The military leadership has both interest in and concern about the UFO phenomenon. If there are any keepers of the keys, they reside in DoD middle management and civilian DoD contractors BDM, SAIC, Boeing, Lockheed, and the controllers who monitor the flow of money to certain classified and special access programs and quote. Outside of the Wilson Davis notes, there are numerous possible high level SAIC personnel serving as gatekeepers for UFO programs discussed already today.

00;42;44;12 - 00;43;10;23
Unknown
And in my previous work, we have the US Admiral, director of the NSA, Deputy Director of the CIA, Director of Neuro, Vice Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and chairman of SAIC Bobby Ray Inman, who went from in 1989 discussing recovered UFOs becoming available for technological research with NASA mission specialist Bob Batchelor to seem he found plausible answers for all UFO sightings to project unity in 2022.

00;43;10;27 - 00;43;38;11
Unknown
We can also take an interesting look at US Navy Admiral William F Raybon, alongside John Deutch and Bobby Ray Inman. Reborn was plucked for senior CIC roles to stack the contractors payroll with scores of influential members of the national security establishment. Prior to his retirement from the Navy in 1963, and also prior to his positions within SAIC and the Director of National Intelligence from 1965 to 1966.

00;43;38;11 - 00;44;10;10

Rayburn led the project to develop the Polaris missile system. The Polaris program, a two stage, solid fueled, nuclear armed, submarine launched ballistic missile, should sound extremely familiar to some viewers of my Naval UFO legacy programs. Video A small detail, but in this video, I discussed how Doctor John P Craven, chief scientist of the Special Projects Office for the US Navy, spearheaded the Deep System Submergence Project and resulting Deep submergence rescue vehicles that I implicated in undersea UFO crash retrieval operations.

00;44;10;11 - 00;44;36;07
Unknown
Craven himself stated the aforementioned DSP and submersibles, DSR RVs were used for a tremendous amount of clandestine and classified missions. Craven also stated in his book The Silent War The Deep Submergence Systems Project, which served to drastically increase the depth at which the Navy could perform undersea engineering operations, was created specifically to accomplish retrieval operations under Operation Sand Dollar.

00;44;36;10 - 00;45;03;25
Unknown
According to Cravens memoirs, sand was a clandestine, highly compartmentalized project that was tasked to retrieve militarily sensitive hardware and other items of national security importance from the seafloor of the continental shelf in the deep marine environments. Craven wrote that this program sand Dollar is classified to this day. Quote I was shown an inventory itemizing the items known to be on the seabed and a map of their distribution throughout the world.

00;45;03;25 - 00;45;33;13
Unknown
End quote outlining the complicated obfuscation of sand dollar within the special access program world Doctor Craven would state sand dollar was buried within the structure of yet another secret program, itself hidden within the Polaris program. Intriguing how Sandler. What I wager was a UFO crash retrieval program was buried under a web of programs hidden within the players program, a program itself founded by Admiral Raybon, who would later on become an SAIC board member.

Let's finally discuss a possible gatekeeper to wave to deep Sixed UFO programs with high level ties to CIA and SAIC. Donald M Kerr Kerr joined SAIC in 1993 as a corporate executive and vice president and director. Kerr's resume includes director of Los Alamos National Labs from 79 to 85, president and director of E, G and G from 89 to 92, CIA Deputy Director for Science and Technology from 01205.

00;46;05;08 - 00;46;48;05

Director of the NRO from 05207, and Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence from oh seven to oh nine. Recall, if you will, the 1985 Advanced Theoretical Physics Working Group and the notes of attendee Oki Shannon, former manager of special projects at Los Alamos and character in the Wilson Davis Notes held at the BDM secure facility in McLean, Virginia, this conference, classified via D.o.e. controls, was supervised by the infamous Colonel John B Alexander and held at BDM just one year after one of the primary characters of this channel, U.S. Army Intercom General Albert Stubble Binh, joined BDM international.

Okey Shannon. Startling notes from this conference reveal several discussions of interest for this channel, including mention of a major engineering project that existed under Admiral Bobby Ray Inman. Naval information on underwater UFO hotspots near Golfo San Matthias, Argentina, and mention of an organization that collects, manages and destroys UFO information. Scribbled within the notes are actions Oakey wish to pursue to continue a quest for cracking UFO reverse engineering programs.

Towards the end of this page is a note discussing approaching Donald Kerr for influence and money. In almost every single project I do, I discuss the CIA's Office of Global Access, established under the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology in 2003 to serve as a logistics coordinator, harnessing the muscle of Joint Special Operations Command for foreign UFO crash retrievals.

00;47;43;07 - 00;48;17;19
Unknown
This CIA DST was additionally, alongside the Navy, the co-founder of Neuro, the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, the US's most secret intelligence agency, and one I've connected to underwater UFO crash retrievals. This Office of Global Access was actually established under the watch of Donald Kerr, former VP of SAIC in the 90s, who, remember, served as the deputy director of the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology from oh one to oh five.

00;48;17;22 - 00;48;35;03
Unknown
Well, so that had us. I mean, I don't want to cut you off, but how does a program like that get funded? I will give you generalities. I can get very specific in a closed session. But misappropriation of funds and, does that mean that one does that mean that there is money in the budget that is set to go to a program?

00;48;35;03 - 00;48;59;03
Unknown
But it doesn't, and it goes to something else? Yes, I have specific knowledge of that. Yep. Do you think U.S. corporations are overcharging for certain tech they're selling to the US government, and that additional money is going to programs correct. Through something called I read in 2004, Catherine Austin Fitz, former assistant secretary for Housing and Urban Development, released the now legendary paper titled Black Budget of the United States.

00;48;59;03 - 00;49;34;15
Unknown
Throughout the 21st century, Fitz has identified trillions of dollars spent on the U.S black budget, which has outlined $21 trillion in unauthorized spending in the departments of Defense and Housing and Urban Development from 1995 to 2015. Much of this money on UFO related, quote unquote, clandestine military R&D. Recently, Fitz made a couple of podcast appearances on Tucker Carlson's and Danny Jones shows, making some incredible statements regarding one of my favorite topics deep underground military bases or domes.

00;49;34;15 - 00;49;57;24
Unknown
Over the years, Fitz has also engaged in some intriguing discussion of UFO legacy programs on dark Journalists page, including UFO economies one, two, and three. Here's here's the thing. I'm glad you brought this up, because I know, I know you've had Richard on. And again, Richard's going to be on the report next week. And that's Richard Dolan, the author of UFOs and the National Security State.

00;49;57;27 - 00;50;46;24
Unknown
Well, the that's the best book in terms of describing the mechanisms put in place after World War two to create, you know, a far expanded infrastructure for what I call the black budget. So you literally see the federal credit engineered in a way that can generate trillions and trillions of dollars for an infrastructure of private corporations and investors to control the most powerful technology in the world, and to try and figure out what that technology is, you know, is to go down a rabbit hole full of very squiggly information about, you know, what is and is not true, but but suffice it to say, you know, that a tremendous amount of that money

00;50;46;24 - 00;51;28;03
Unknown
has gone into various high technology weaponry and and certainly an investment in space and space travel. Fits is surprisingly well versed in UFO legacy programs, commenting on covert space economies, breakaway civilizations, the SDI or Strategic Defense Initiative being used to counter extraterrestrial threats, and black budget operations surrounding UFOs. Fitz even once argued to dark journalist up to $60 trillion may have been spent on secret space program and UFO technologies, suggesting to, you know, or technologies of unknown origin may be worth up to $150 trillion.

00;51;28;06 - 00;51;52;00
Unknown
Perhaps one day I can sit down with Katherine Austin Fitz and have a very poignant discussion on UFO legacy program financing. But I would like to circle back to black budget of the United States. In the paper, Fitz writes, quote, large portions of the nation's wealth is being illegally diverted into secret, unaccountable channels and, quote, to support clandestine domestic military research and development.

00;51;52;02 - 00;52;25;13
Unknown
Whilst at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Fitz came across evidence IT accounting systems providers were responsible for the obfuscation of funds and omitting data where DoD funds were directed. These included Lockheed Martin Information Systems, which would later merge with Leidos in 2015, IBM, DynCorp, and of course, SAIC one of the things I used to have these fights with the defense contractors, because I was required to to get the accounts when we, I still needed data.

00;52;25;13 - 00;52;50;22
Unknown
And the systems were run by the big defense contractors at HUD, and they would refuse to give me the data. So I would have these wars with them. Like, who really runs HUD? Is it the defense contractor, or is it the point, you know, the person who's legally responsible, right. And speculating, I say it's a they have a very perfect situation.

00;52;50;25 - 00;53;47;02
Unknown
To do any type of research they want to, under the guise of anything. I mean, and call it what they want. And they definitely aren't working alone in anything. So anybody doing business with them, they are what's called like a conglomerate. There's SAIC, but it's made up of numerous individual corporations and these corporations, some of them are very well known and some of them are smaller, but they have some very big genius minds there and a lot of very cutting edge work being done there, and millions and millions of dollars coming in and since it's privately owned corporations, I don't know, the only people they'd have to report to is the ones that

00;53;47;02 - 00;54;22;08
Unknown
are doing business with and contracting with. And so if the people they're contracting with which wish to, Do, something that maybe isn't in the best interests of everyone, nobody's going to know about it. It's all kept in-house. The funding, the financing, the contracts. There should be files. There should be documentation and a regular, timeline of events on every project which did not exist whatsoever.

00;54;22;10 - 00;54;49;18
Unknown
And if I'm working in a military division and I have access to all the files. Where were these? Where was this documentation? So it made me very suspicious of where all this money was going. Let's now reference the 2001 testimony. A former SAIC administrative employee, Denise McKenzie McKenzie's testimony is somewhat legendary in the UFO legacy program. Financial analyst community.

00;54;49;18 - 00;55;14;04
Unknown
After all, McKenzie's experiences were detailed on text in Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure briefing document, and she was never heard from again. It's even more interesting the big defense contractor that does all the UFO stuff, like for the military and the government, is in La Hoya and out in front of their building. They have two eight foot tall Egyptian statues and one is holding a pyramid in his hand.

00;55;14;07 - 00;55;33;08
Unknown
And it says the past, and one's holding a pyramid in his hand, and it says the future. And they're big bronze statues in front of of this company. And this company I have on one of these tapes a girl testifying how they put billions of dollars or millions of dollars into UFO related programs, and they create them. They're fake.

00;55;33;12 - 00;55;55;27
Unknown
So then they get audited by the General Accounting Office of the United States Government. It just looks like all the money is going into more helicopters, but it's really going into like UFO related programs. Today, I'm thrilled to announce I have found McKenzie's March 2001 videotaped interview, nestled within the files of the DPI archive. I have also found and made outreach to Mrs. McKenzie herself.

00;55;55;27 - 00;56;17;06
Unknown
I do hope she connects with me in the future, but for now, let's analyze her complete recorded testimony. McKenzie was introduced to SAIC while working retail in 1992 while working at a fabric store in a San Diego mall, a part time coworker of McKenzie named Sophia asked her to move to SAIC at La Hoya San Diego, where Sofia primarily worked.

00;56;17;06 - 00;56;38;02
Unknown
Denise had never heard of the defense giant, but was intrigued to work a cushy office job on a massive campus. When she first visited the La Hoya site, McKenzie expected to interview for an administrative assistant position, but with no paperwork or meetings. McKenzie was immediately told she had the job. She didn't even know the department in which she was supposed to work.

00;56;38;07 - 00;56;58;13
Unknown
During her first few days in the office, McKenzie noticed her recruiter, Sophia, was not present at SAIC and wouldn't show up for another 2 to 3 weeks. During her first 3 to 4 days of work, McKenzie had no real tasks. She would wander her building of work to look busy gauging the department's computer files and personnel McKenzie would relay.

00;56;58;13 - 00;57;43;13
Unknown
She worked within six military contract division within SAIC La Hoya. On Campus Drive, Denise would notice a highly classified biological division that featured extremely strict personnel access control. And let's take a quick pause here. SAIC has a history of intriguing chemical and biological contracts. Let's note this 2005 SAIC research, development, Test and Evaluation Group contract. That test six McLean, Virginia and San Diego, California divisions to perform biological, chemical, radiological, nuclear, and explosive or CB R&D work with the Air Force Operational Test Center and Evaluation Center, or AFO, TSC at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico.

00;57;43;13 - 00;58;26;29
Unknown
Kirtland Air Force Base is not only home to a deep underground military installation, but also to Sandia National Labs and FFR ADC, which is a usual tricky customer of this channel for operational locations of UFO legacy programs. Recurring viewers of my channel will absolutely recognize Sandia. And by the way, CIC has a history of absolute lutely enormous contracts with Sandia National Labs, such as this 2013 $228 million contract for IT consolidation for, quote, mission specific information technology research, development and integration of capabilities while maintaining high performance and central hosting computing desktops, services and cybersecurity.

00;58;26;29 - 00;58;57;00
Unknown
End quote. What is interesting about this specific relationship with SAIC and AFO tech for CB, or any work we just mentioned above, is a quote from SAIC Senior Vice President Chuck Zang. Quote. Under the CBRE contract, SAIC will assess new and emerging technologies and concepts will work to determine their technological maturity when operated under realistic environments to help give us warfighters the tools they need to do their jobs more safely and effectively.

00;58;57;00 - 00;59;27;25
Unknown
End quote. It is interesting how SAIC biological work has been contracted from AFO tech or the Air Force operational Test and Evaluation Center we just mentioned above. AFO tech historically has supported the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense, Advanced Systems and Concepts. Or do USD As and C for all nontraditional acquisition programs. In the future, I'll be paying much closer attention to this d USD, SNC and the offices possible involvement in UFO legacy programs.

00;59;27;25 - 01;00;00;01
Unknown
After all, according to the General Accounting Office, in 2002 d USD, SNC was responsible for DoD Advanced Concept Technology demonstration programs. The connections to our work here are indeed perplexing. SAIC has a history of being awarded sole source contracts to support the Joint Technology Assessment Activity, or JTA. A large part of the JTA portfolio supports the deputy undersecretary of defense for Advanced Systems and Concepts, or the de USD SNC.

01;00;00;03 - 01;00;26;22
Unknown
Many of these sole source CIC, JTA contracts are for work at, you guessed it, the Naval Surface Warfare Center crane, which allegedly houses the Offworld Technologies Division. Funny enough, former D USD, a SNC appointees have a history of working for contractors suspected of being involved with UFO legacy program operations before and after service in the office of the Undersecretary for defense.

01;00;26;22 - 01;00;53;03
Unknown
These include Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Susie Payton, who served as a manager of advanced technology, and Lockheed Martin before her service in the DoD. But after that brief sidestep into SAIC and their biological departments, let's get back to the story of Denise McKenzie. McKenzie's work, picked up when she received numerous letters from U.S. military and defense contractors requesting project report updates.

01;00;53;06 - 01;01;23;20
Unknown
Mackenzie's immediate superiors blew off the importance of these project report updates, instructing McKenzie to issue a generic response to DoD and contractors alike. Since something to the effect of, quote, we're working on it, end quote, eager to perform efficiently. In her new role, Denise McKenzie would retrieve files and computer disks pertaining to the letters she received. Each and every contract file, ranging from recent to several years old, contained only 2 to 3 form letters, all stating the same thing.

Quote. It's being worked on, end quote. Some of these forms were signed by SAIC senior personnel and some were left completely unsigned. These were enormous contracts worth millions and millions of dollars, with absolutely zero activity on the contracts. McKenzie reported the missing contract activity to her recruiter, Sophia, who grew furious. Denise took initiative to search through Sykes file database.

01;01;50;22 - 01;02;18;09
Unknown
During her interview, Denise pondered why Sophia, positioned under Sykes head scientist, was working and recruiting new SAIC administrative personnel from a fabric store at a mall. McKenzie was ordered to bring all files and discs pertaining to relevant contracts to her immediate superiors, and to forget all about the matter in her following short time at SAIC, McKenzie was harassed by her head supervisor, a man named Stuart Stanley.

01;02;18;09 - 01;02;39;16
Unknown
I'm trying to track down this Stuart, and while unable to find him yet, I have uncovered a man by that name residing in La Hoya, San Diego. At the time of Denise's employment at SAIC. Mackenzie's final straw occurred at the contractor when she choked on food and her immediate supervisor stood by and watched instead of attempting to help or to call an ambulance.

01;02;39;22 - 01;03;16;20
Unknown
After leaving the company, Mackenzie would search the early internet for her recruiter, Sophia, and would eventually find an image of Sophia on a CIA website with a different first name and same last name. This web page listed deceased agents, and while her incident took place in 1992, quote unquote, Sophia had supposedly died in 1987 or 1988. Remember, if you will, Sykes relationship with the NSA, intimate ties with the US big five intelligence agencies appear rampant with SAIC, although they're getting a lot of money for doing nothing.

01;03;16;20 - 01;03;45;09

And I didn't know where that money was going. It's like a friend. A friend for some. I mean, if it wasn't such a big complex and and, evidently well known, which I found out, you know, as I worked there, I would have been very suspicious of what what was going on. And if we wanted to, just hide funds or or push funds through and call it whatever you want.

Joe's market, I mean, I mean, it was like Jo's market on a huge scale. So, but what was I to do about it? You know, I there wasn't much I could say or do about it. McKenzie was not the only SAIC employee in 1992 to make such allegations. According to the excellent 2007 Vanity Fair article titled Washington's Shadow, quote.

01;04;10;11 - 01;04;39;14
Unknown
According to one former executive, in a sworn deposition in 1992, the practice of quote unquote miss charging became institutionalized within the company. End quote. Analyzing Mackenzie's testimony, we can see SAIC ran enormous contracts with DoD and other contractors with absolutely zero activity on these contracts. This implies these moneys were funneled from legitimate projects into more secret black budget clandestine operations.

01;04;39;14 - 01;04;47;00

And perhaps we have a real instance of this. We can analyze.

Here, an artist's projection of the president's vision. Bending into space a layered defense to protect the country from nuclear devastation. U.S. spy satellites would watch the world below detect Soviet missiles blasting off, compute the position and speed of each missile alert and battle stations in space on Earth. The first response space based kinetic energy weapons via high speed projectiles from high velocity guns intercepting enemy missiles, and they are boosted through the atmosphere, bumped up into space.

Particle beam weapons with pulsing rays showing the attack still over the atmosphere. In the same year of 1992, then Secretary of Defense the infamous Dick Cheney was called to investigate whistleblower claims of fraud and waste surrounding the Strategic Defense Initiative. Since 1986, scientist Aldrick Saucier claimed the SDI or star Wars program displayed a pattern of, quote, mismanagement and abuse and wasteful spending on research and development and, quote, misreporting and misleading Congress of its efficacy.

01;06;27;08 - 01;07;03;07
Unknown
Saucier was dismissed from the Star Wars program for quote unquote, poor performance, and was even investigated by the FBI. Democratic Congressman John Conyers determined actions against Saucier were whistleblower retaliatory activities, and by 1992, Cheney reviewed the case and Saucier was given whistleblower protection. But why is any of this important here? I have talked in several projects of backdoor UFO programs being built into Ronald Reagan's 1983 Strategic Defense Initiative, a missile defense system built to defend the United States from attacks by ballistic nuclear missiles.

01;07;03;13 - 01;07;33;28
Unknown
Let's break this down in a second. But since SDI inception in 1983, U.S. contractors, including SAIC and their systems integrator abilities were relied on more than ever by the Defense Department for successful implementation of SDI. In 1985, SAIC had an employee, retired USAF two star General Jasper Welch, that exclusively coordinated with Star Wars efforts. In 1985, SAIC had one more Strategic Defense Initiative related contracts than General Dynamics.

01;07;33;28 - 01;08;10;24
Unknown
Northrop Raytheon, and Grumman and the Rand Corporation combined. Beginning in 1978 and throughout Star Wars, SAIC was, quote, the best represented contractor and quote for a key SDI technology particle beam weapons. So essentially, SAIC had been accused by Katherine Austin Fitz as back channeling money from legitimate contracts into clandestine operations. Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative was proven by the whistleblower claims of Aldrich Saucier to purposely mislead Congress on the efficacy of SDI and, quote, wasteful spending on research and development, end quote.

01;08;10;29 - 01;08;37;07
Unknown
And CIC was considered a critical contractor for their expertise and reliability for critical work on SDI. Now, I just previously said there are numerous implications. SDI actually held a swath of UFO programs that saw secret monies back, channeled from primarily SDI funding mechanisms with SAIC work on SDI, and history of illegally diverting funds from legitimate to black budget contracts.

01;08;37;07 - 01;09;11;14
Unknown
I do not at all think it is a stretch to assume SAIC was one of the primary contractors engaged with SDI and UFO legacy programs. Previously, I discussed the involvement of Northrop, the Grumman Corporation, and Teledyne Ryan, a Northrop Grumman purchase in regards to SDI and UFO programs. But today we have much more to discuss. One whistleblower I have covered in depth on this channel is former USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fu Shaye and his claims of the reverse engineered alien reproduction vehicle called the TR three B.

01;09;11;17 - 01;09;36;27
Unknown
As I have stated before, although Fisher was unable to provide material evidence for the existence of TR three B, his disclosures have served to deliver some extremely actionable intelligence. During his 1998 disclosures, Boucher would discuss the Daas, the Defense Advanced Research Center allegedly stationed underground near area 51 Group Lake that worked on UFO reverse engineering and material exploitation projects.

01;09;36;29 - 01;10;06;03
Unknown
The Daas in question. The Defense Advanced Research Center, not to be confused with DARPA. The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency was actually a proposed institution. So let's reference this declassified Advanced Research Project Agency study written in 1973. The study in question was written as a historical evaluation of the R&D management institution Arpa, who at this time had, quote, remarkably little in the way of an official record or institutional memory had been established.

01;10;06;03 - 01;10;32;27
Unknown
End quote on page 82 of the document under Arpa laboratories discussing advanced aerospace projects, we find a DoD directive showing the Army Ballistic Missile Agency was considered for transfer into the Daas, the Defense Advanced Research Center, linking the department to the jet Propulsion Laboratory. And it is worth noting the Army Ballistic Missile Agency was commanded by Nazi V-2 rocket scientist in Operation Paperclip transfer.

01;10;32;27 - 01;11;02;08

Verner von Braun. Von Braun's mentor, was father of German rocketry Hermann Oberth, who performed extensive study on UFOs, and I have previously covered how extensively Nazi scientists were involved in early UFO programs, such as discussing Hans Kahler, director of numerous Nazi special weapons projects, who may have been tasked with studying the 1933 magenta, Italy crashed UFO, who curiously went missing near the end of the war but was claimed to be working with Americans.

01;11;02;08 - 01;11;30;00
Unknown
Post-World War Two, as well as Xavier Dorsch, head of the Tott organization, who was requested by Air Materiel Command for Operation Paperclip for underground plant construction through Sherwood State. Daas was bolstered in the mid 1980s, when the institution was flushed with money from the Strategic Defense Initiative Fund, and his sources estimated up to 35% of SDI funding was siphoned off to support the UFO black programs.

01;11;30;03 - 01;12;06;21
Unknown
Indeed, for its maiden operational flight in the mid 1990s for Sherwood State, the TR3 B, whose program was administrated by the NRO, NSA and CIA and worked primarily by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop and Teledyne Ryan. The reverse engineered vehicle was built by Strategic Defense Initiative money. In 2013. Stealth aircraft researcher Joseph Jones would claim the existence of Project Brilliant Buzzard, a codename for an airborne surveillance and tracking program that dealt with setting up an electromagnetic shield around the U.S utilizing an enormous boomerang shaped craft.

01;12;06;23 - 01;12;43;09
Unknown
This boomerang featured an almost indefinite loiter time, and Brilliant Buzzard was allegedly primarily contracted to Boeing. The Brilliant Buzzard craft was seemingly responsible for 25,000 eyewitness sightings between 1983 and 1989 of the Hudson Valley Boomerang, and this enormous craft was, of course, allegedly a program born from the Strategic Defense Initiative. Viewers of my channel will know I adore referencing the work of legendary UFO crash retrieval investigator Leonard Stringfield to analyze relevant UFO crash retrieval and material exploits and cases.

01;12;43;11 - 01;13;13;03
Unknown
And as it turns out, we do have a rather intriguing Star Wars case and crash retrieval status reports one through seven, specifically 1991 the UFO Crash Retrievals, the Inner Sanctum Status Report, Six String Fields eclectic work analyzed the 1989 UFO crash retrieval case alleged to have occurred over Moriches Bay, Long Island, New York, USA. Now be mindful that there is an additional Long Island, New York UFO crash retrieval case that allegedly occurred in 1992.

01;13;13;05 - 01;14;00;20
Unknown
This 92 case is indeed perplexing and features numerous eyewitnesses and the possible involvement of the Department of Energy's FTC. Brookhaven National Laboratory, located in Upton, New York. Perhaps we will revisit this case in an extended session soon, but let's circle back to 1989. The work of Stringfield and reporting from early UFO on the Long Island UFO network. This case details a crashed UFO in the area of Moriches Bay off the south shore of Suffolk County, Long Island, New York on the early morning of 29th September 1989, and according to Lifan and Stringfield, the craft crashing was not an accident, but instead a carefully planned and executed military intelligence operation to down the craft.

01;14;00;22 - 01;14;30;29
Unknown
According to an anonymous Air Force intelligence Colonel quote, the incident involved the downing of a UFO by the use of a US Star Wars weapon. On that night, the craft crashed into the dune area, where it was subsequently retrieved and quote. Quite shockingly, this unnamed colonel additionally stated 18 U.S. servicemen were killed by biologics on board the craft, who retaliated with a device that, quote, generates extremely low frequency sound waves which can destroy the molecular cohesiveness of known matter.

01;14;31;02 - 01;15;13;02
Unknown
Quite the extraordinary claim in a claim that I can find no record of regarding the deaths of several U.S. servicemen. However, multiple eyewitnesses, including a commodities broker, claimed to have seen helicopters transporting a large object and military vehicles with a police escort headed towards Brookhaven National Labs. Another anonymous source, this time a Brookhaven scientist named doctor Nick, told Live On investigators a large wedge or boomerang shaped object with shockingly low mass was recovered and transported to Brookhaven, having previously worked under Wright-Patterson AFB to study UFOs, doctor Nick claimed the weapon utilized to down the craft was constructed by ICL electronics.

01;15;13;04 - 01;16;00;14
Unknown
Now remember how the anonymous colonel claimed the craft was down by a Strategic Defense Initiative weapon? And according to doctor Nick Brookhaven, National Labs deployed this weapon. Brookhaven is of course, a Department of Energy sponsored for RDC. Brookhaven additionally did work on the Strategic Defense Initiative, such as aiding in SDI lethality and target hardening projects. Reference. For example, this 1987 document titled quote, report to the Congress on Strategic Defense Initiative and quote, alongside White Sands Missile Range and Los Alamos National Labs, Brookhaven aided SDI through study and testing of SDI weapons that, quote, required lethal energy to achieve a sure kill against the full spectrum of enemy targets and quote one contractor that worked alongside

01;16;00;14 - 01;16;28;04
Unknown
Brookhaven, White Sands and Los Alamos for SDI lethality and target hardening program was, of course, SAIC. Interesting how sickened Brookhaven, which was allegedly involved with shooting down a UFO over Long Island, New York. Both worked on SDI and specifically the Defense Nuclear Agency's lethality and target hardening programs that had a specific goal of assessing the lethality of x ray laser weapons against SDI threats.

01;16;28;04 - 01;16;57;28
Unknown
All this boils down, of course, to the subject of directed energy weapons. Sources of mine have specifically informed me of SDI x ray weapons that were used to disable and down UFOs. These connections between SAIC black budget monies and Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative are quite potent and well worth exploring further in our future studies. SAIC s misappropriation of funds doesn't just stop with the testimony of McKenzie or likely involvement with SDI.

01;16;57;28 - 01;17;29;20
Unknown
UFO programs know we have very real examples of SAIC wasting obscene amounts of money on contracts. In 2002, a consortium run by SAIC, including Boeing and Booz Allen Hamilton, was chosen by the National Security Agency to create trailblazer, a system intended to analyze mass collections of data on communication methods such as cell phones, email, and internet. This contract was worth, at its inception, over $280 million and ballooned to billions within four years.

01;17;29;20 - 01;17;57;12
Unknown
This program was even worked on by SAIC board member Bobby Ray Inman. Multiple NSA employees filed a complaint with the DoD Inspector General regarding enormous amounts of fraud, waste, and abuse existing in six trailblazer when a successful operating prototype had already previously existed. By 2005, the DoD Inspector General released a report on the investigation where 90 plus percent of the findings were redacted.

01;17;57;16 - 01;18;28;16
Unknown
Some of the whistleblowers here, including NSA employee William Binney, were harassed and raided by the FBI. Interesting how Binney has additionally commented on UFOs. Oh, I think, my my problem is just like the, like the UFO, thing, unless they start addressing these kinds of things that people are, people's observations or, or basic measurement or backdoor kind of evidence that, that simply exists unless, like third addressing them, they're always going to there's always going to be quite soon as people are going to quit.

01;18;28;18 - 01;19;05;13
Unknown
And never I mean, ethically now with the government, how much do you have in this government? Bizarrely, after the colossal failure that was trailblazer, SAIC was immediately awarded a contract for execute Locus, a revised trailblazer program well worth $361 million. Six failed efforts on enormous contracts are not uncommon. Take visa, for example. Virtual case file a $124 million contract with the FBI to create an online central repository of data to serve the FBI only three years into virtual case file.

01;19;05;13 - 01;19;34;15

The project was written off by a global publication for technology professionals as the quote, most highly publicized software failure in history and quote. According to the 2007 Vanity Fair article on SAIC, we discussed earlier quote if it turns out they can't deliver, new contracts will simply be drawn up. End quote. Indeed. Six convenient ineptitude to secure lucrative contracts for no work and whopping failures doesn't just end here.

In 2005, six La Hoya San Diego location, which was patrolled by D.O.D. certified industrial security personnel, was broken into. This never solved burglary, according to SAIC, saw the theft of one desktop computer and four laptops out of 13 private offices containing personal data on thousands of present and past employees, presumably including the company's many former CIA operatives, NSA executives and Pentagon officials.

01;20;03;10 - 01;20;51;04
Unknown
Quite the targeted theft here, and I really cannot stress here how many incredibly suspicious and dubious actions SAIC has conducted over the years. That speaks to misappropriation and funneling of funds used, in my opinion, for black budget UFO programs. Further examples in this laundry list include SAIC defrauding the US government from 1987 to 1995 by creating fake Nonfunctioning prototypes for a USAF contract to develop flat panel liquid crystal displays to be used on various fighter jets, as well as an early 2000 incident in which SAIC was charged with fraud for submitting, quote, false and fraudulent statements of its expected cost and profits, unquote, for waste cleanup at various U.S. Air Force bases.

01;20;51;08 - 01;21;22;03
Unknown
But before we move on here, I would like to touch on some of the relationships SAIC has maintained with DoD defense contractors that have been time and time again implicated with black budget projects and UFO legacy programs. I'd like to draw your attention back to e.g., Angie, also known as Ed Girton, German Housing in Greer Inc, and I would wager most on this channel have some familiarity with this intriguing contractor that historically engaged closely with some of the US's most secret technologies.

01;21;22;05 - 01;22;04;23
Unknown
Started by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Harold Edgar, written in 1931 e.g., Angie's activities are legendary in the UFO community before the company was acquired by Urs in 2002 and again by a Aecom in 2014. Historically, e.g. Angie shared responsibility at the Nevada Test Site, including Nellis Air Force Base and Area 51 for weapons development and high tech testing alongside Lawrence Livermore Labs, Raytheon, and others e.g., Angie's legendary status in the UFO community arose from it being labeled as the contractor Bob Lazaro claimed hired him to reverse engineer UFO propulsion systems at area 51, site four.

01;22;04;29 - 01;22;31;13

Quite recently, I also discussed how SGA was one of multiple components connected with UFO legacy programs that comprise the Department of Energy, Nest or Nuclear Emergency Response Team, and how I wager the D.o.e. nest, supported by SGA, was the on site technical and scientific team that recovered a crashed UFO in the Peruvian jungle in 1997, witnessed by USMC Lance Corporal Jonathan Wiegand.

01;22;31;20 - 01;23;09;01
Unknown
According to journalist George Knapp, Alfred O'Donnell, a now deceased former senior manager at SGA, relayed to Knapp that quote unquote, they meaning SGA, had in its possession a flying saucer recovered in New Mexico, as well as live non-human beings that looked vaguely human. Remember SGA, but just stick around here with me for a second. As I state to probably an annoying degree, a key component overlooked from joint U.S contractor UFO Legacy program operations are the subject matter experts and R&D Aces, FFR, DCS, or federally funded research and development centers.

01;23;09;01 - 01;23;40;14
Unknown
Over the course of my work, I have accused numerous such FFR DCS as acting as key players in UFO material exploitation and crash retrieval programs, including Sandia National Labs, Lawrence Livermore National Labs, Los Alamos National Labs. The center for naval analyzes the Miter Corporation, the Rand Corporation, and more. The administrator for Los Alamos National Labs, for example, on behalf of the Department of Energy, is a little known corporation known as Triad National Security, LLC.

01;23;40;15 - 01;24;13;06
Unknown
Triad National Security has a storied history of intriguing publications, but relevant to our discussion is how triad is comprised of three entities Texas A&M University, the University of California, and Battelle Memorial Institute, along side FFR ADCs. I have spoken on their university semi-private counterparts, U. Arcs or university affiliated research centers, and their involvement in UFO legacy programs. The two universities comprising triad are not you are ex, but interesting nonetheless.

01;24;13;09 - 01;24;51;24
Unknown
The contractor here of interest within Triad is Battelle and Battelle is no stranger to this channel from its possible involvement studying Roswell Shape Memory Alloys to its parallel project Bluebook called Project Store to research associate Dean Battelle to Dugway Proving Ground UFO legacy programs. Battelle is infamous on this channel. Battelle itself runs multiple FFR ADCs, including Oak Ridge, a Sean Kirkpatrick Safe Haven Post Arrow where he joined as CTO, Savannah River National Labs, and the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center, all of whom I suspect are involved in UFO legacy programs.

01;24;51;24 - 01;25;26;06
Unknown
So isn't it interesting that Battelle formed a new LLC under a trio of institutions to manage sites for the Department of Energy? Here, we can finally circle back. On 15th September 2004, SAIC entered into a similar venture, analyzing a form ten sec document. We can see that in 2004, SAIC entered into an agreement with e.g. Technical Services as well as Parsons Infrastructure and Technology Group, Inc. to form RDX Research and Development Solutions, LLC, a now defunct group.

01;25;26;14 - 01;25;55;04

DDS was quickly assigned to the Department of Energy's National Energy Technical Laboratory shortly after its founding, with a total value of $217 million. Indeed, by 27th September 2004, Rwdsu was securing even more contracts with Doe, with some contracts of up to $41 million. The Doe's National Energy Technical Laboratory's mission is to, quote, advance the national economic and energy security of the United States.

01;25;55;04 - 01;26;25;21

End quote. In R.D. s founding year, the nettle had a budget of over $900 million, which was used for R&D programs in support of the Doe's offices of Fossil Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Renewable Energy and Energy Assurance, as well as work with other federal agencies. DSS was brought on to support the management and integration of all stages of science and technology development at ETL, which could lead to commercially viable solutions in the energy area.

Specific technical services areas to be performed include R&D, technology planning and analysis, R&D operations, process engineering, design and analysis, computational research, simulation and visualization. Environment safety and health assurance, and partnership development. End quote. Of course, NTL has no direct connection we can see to UFO legacy programs, but it is interesting that NTL does have connections to three companies, ranging from possibly to almost certainly involved in UFO legacy programs outside of DSS, CIC engaged in multiple projects with E.g. and GE, as well as other contractors I suspect engage in UFO exploitation programs such as L3, Harris and Alien Science and Technology.

As demonstrated in this 2005 250 million Joint Warfighting Center support contract. If Alien Science and technology sits on the tip of your tongue, this very well may be because this is a contractor mentioned alongside the testimony of witness Ed. Ed served as a director for an electronics warfare group out of the Edwards for 12 Test Wing, which is a major range and test facility base, and claim to work directly with scientists and test pilots of reverse engineered UFO vehicles.

01;27;41;25 - 01;28;11;03
Unknown
According to Ed, this program operated across the Nevada Test and Training range, as well as the Edwards for 12th Test Wing comprising Edwards Air Force Base, Nellis Air Force Base Area 51 S-4 and Underground Connective Tissue. After his very real time at Edwards, Ed went on to work at the Pentagon for USAF research, development, Test and Evaluation Panel chain, where he claimed dozens of billions of dollars went missing each year in non tioa or non transfer of authority funds.

01;28;11;10 - 01;28;37;26
Unknown
During his time at the Pentagon, Ed also joined Alien Science and Technologies in Crystal city, Virginia as an F-35 subject matter expert. I have also guessed with the enormous, bloated budget of the F-35 program, around $2 trillion, this aircraft platform may hide funds for UFO program operations in a similar venture to Ardsley by SAIC and EG and G and Triad National Security LLC.

Under Battelle in 1999, the same year, Northrop Grumman purchased Teledyne Ryan and was engaged in a purchasing spree. I have connected to UFO programs SAIC and Northrop entered a joint venture to create Am. SAC, LLC, and SAC grew from $100 million in revenue in 2000 to $500 million in revenue by 2007. Quote and SAC contracts, primarily with the Navy, are expected to gross $500 million next year, and SAC is jointly owned by Newport News Shipbuilding, a division of Northrop Grumman, and Science Applications International Corporation, end quote, and specializes in providing naval architecture and marine engineering, naval ship systems assessments, maintenance engineering, waterfront maintenance support, acquisition program support, shipyard industrial engineering and C4 AI installation and

In my projects, when discussing DoD contractors for season irks, I try and single out official reports, internal reports, defense technical Intelligence Center documents, etc. to attempt to draw parallels to UFO legacy programs. Previous references have included project updates on Project Stork and metallurgical alloy analysis by Battelle. TRW is work on high speed underground tunnels possibly connecting deep underground military bases.

1972 Project Outgrowth out of the U.S. Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base, detailing anti-gravity propulsion and many, many, many more. Of course, seen as it's our subject today, SAIC has their own compelling historical documentation. In 1988, SAIC began work on a report titled Electric Propulsion Study for Edwards Air Force Base's Aeronautics Laboratory in the Air Force Base Technology Center, AFC.

Of course, as we've discussed throughout today, viewers of my channel will recall my extremely high conviction regarding a joint UFO, RV Alien Reproduction Vehicle program existing between Edwards Air Force Base and the Nevada Test and Training Range. Again, this was covered in great detail on my video on Ed, an Electronics Warfare Test director out of Edwards who claimed to operate this program engaging with UFO legacy program scientists and RV pilots.

01;31;53;02 - 01;32;27;26

This 1988 SAIC document, released August of 1990, was written by SAIC investigator Dennis Cravens and featured extensive contribution from Assistant Director of Los Alamos National Lab Center for Explosive Technology Research, Ferris Williams. This paper discusses the Byfield Brown effect, Los Alamos National Labs, and Lawrence Livermore National Labs, work on highly classified power density devices for the Strategic Defense Initiative, and ultimately suggests a five dimensional approach to unifications of fields for novel propulsion methods.

The report also suggests anti-gravity could be achieved by using rotating cylinders filled with mercury, and should be considered for oceanic and atmospheric applications intriguing, to say the least, as this rotating mercury system is the exact propulsion method USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Shea claimed originated from reverse engineering out of Sandia and Lawrence Livermore National Labs that powered the TR three B alien reproduction vehicle.

The circular plasma field, accelerated rain column, magnetic field, disrupter surrounds, or rotatable crew compartment. It's far ahead of anything you've ever imagined as far as technology. Sandia and Livermore Laboratories developed reverse engineered MFD, and I believe the government will go to any lengths to protect this technology. But you're not going to be able to build one of these from what I tell you.

Superconductivity and accelerated to 60,000 revolutions per minute to create a superconductive plasma with the resulting gravity energy, the MFD generates a magnetic vortex field, which disrupts and neutralizes the effects of gravity on Mars within proximity.

About 89%. Do not misunderstand. This is not anti-gravity. Anti-Gravity you can use as a propulsive force just for consideration. It is also interesting how this ferrous Williams mentioned in this report also spoke at a June 2001 UFO technology conference where it was mentioned his research was sponsored by Hal, put off. This conference was actually held in La Hoya, San Diego, in immediate proximity to numerous SAIC locations and their California headquarters.

In July of 2018, journalist George Knapp released a leaked version of 38 Dirt Defense Intelligence reference documents created under the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, or Aatip. A tip, of course, is the controversial office Lou Elizondo claimed to direct, work for, or operate under in various capacities. Much discussion has been conducted surrounding Aatip versus Osap, the Advanced Aerospace Weapons System Applications program.

This is, of course, not the subject of today's video, and while I maintain native was likely a white world cover for more classified programs under Osap, we will not be discussing the complexities of Aatip versus Osap today. On 16th January 2019, the Black Vault received a list of the aforementioned Dirty Reports under FOIA. By March 2022, the Black Vault had successfully received copies of all 38 dirt reports.

I have discussed these turds before the subject matter and topics of them are simply astounding. The Dirts feature highly scientific and technical reports by various authors that touch on multiple core positions, from spatial temporal translation to armament. Some of these dirts include focus on space time metric engineering by how put off brain machine interfaces by doctor genic. Pulsed high power microwave weaponry by doctor James Wells, in advanced aerospace configurations by doctor pulses.

And it is interesting how in 2001, Doctor CES appeared as a whistleblower on Stephen Greer's 2001 disclosure briefing document. In his taped testimony to Greer, CES discussed his eight years in the Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and 30 years working for the McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Company. CES discussed its involvement tracking UFOs while at Wright-Patterson. Some clocked at 20,000mph, performing unusual and silent maneuvers, as well as his time in classified projects at McDonnell Douglas within these nerds are numerous papers written by the infamous Doctor Eric Davis, covering such topics as traversable wormholes, stargates, and negative energy.

Anti-Gravity for aerospace applications, and concepts for extracting energy from the quantum vacuum. In a similar vein to these exotic birds, Davis had previously written a mind boggling report from 2001 to 2003 titled Teleportation Physics Study. If you are somehow unfamiliar with Davis, please check out my project on the Wilson Davis Notes or my interview with Davis on Jesse Michaels Channel, Davis wrote teleportation physics study for the Air Force Research Laboratory, Afrl for Air Force Materiel Command at Edwards Air Force Base.

01;37;01;05 - 01;37;27;13

Davis would go on to work at RFE, RL and would state. During the sole 2024 symposium, Afrl was where he uncovered irrefutable evidence of UFO legacy program operations. Teleportation Physics Study devotes an entire report section to P teleportation, a form of psychokinesis quote similar to telekinesis, but generally used to designate the movement of objects through other physical objects over great distances.

01;37;27;13 - 01;38;05;22

Telekinesis is a form of p k which describes the movement of stationary objects without the use of any known physical force, and p k is essentially the direct influence of mind on matter without any known immediate physical energy or instrumentation. End quote. This p k phenomenon p teleportation section stated much of the theoretical experimental operational work on the subject was based off a little known program conducted at Sri International with the NSA, sponsored at times by the CIA, Dia, and U.S. Army INS comm that would later relocate to SAIC.

This was the infamous remote viewing program, aka Project Stargate. Well, if there was like CIA docs about consciousness and like weird remote viewing stuff. I mean, besides the Stargate program, that were released in the foyer reading room on CIA website, two that are pretty trippy were like, wow, CIA's looking into some really interesting stuff. I mean, they're hard core Intel agency, what's going on there?

01;38;31;14 - 01;38;53;22
Unknown
But it makes sense that they would kind of have to find out if that's like, you can't ignore that if you're really doing your job, if your job is intelligence, like, okay, like, let's look at this, an aspect of the phenomenon because it's like, reach out from the crash retrieval program, like, hey, I need you to look into some weird stuff because it might be the key unlock for something that we got in a warehouse, you know?

01;38;53;22 - 01;39;20;17

Yeah. So. Whoa. I speak often on the possibility some non-human vehicles are controlled, not with complex control surfaces, but instead with thoughts or cognition. These sentiments have largely and recently been associated with Jake Barber, and the discussion of psionics and programs focused on utilizing anomalous cognition to lure in UFO to shoot them down with EMP weaponry, and that we can go to conclusion we want to know these are seizures.

01;39;20;19 - 01;39;53;10
Unknown
The reason most flying saucers have failed is because our conclusion was that this being is part of the guidance system, he's part of that saucer. But as we just saw, discussion of UFOs and cognition far predate Barbour. The late Colonel Philip J. Corso would claim he and the Army's Foreign Technology Division under Arthur Trudeau were in the early 1960s tasked with numerous projects for the purpose of seeding and adapting technologies plucked from UFO crash retrieval, specifically Roswell, into the US military and industry if possible.

01;39;53;10 - 01;40;26;08
Unknown
One such project, started in 1961, was focused on quote control guidance by brainwaves and, quote Corso had learned from official Roswell files. The biologics on board the crashed disc were part of the guidance system. The Foreign Technology Division sought to adapt this technology to allow humans to control ballistic missiles via brainwaves. I've just had one of the most senior scientists in the US Defense Department, former admit to me that he was read into a UFO crash retrieval program.

I've spoken to well over 20 people. They're what I was told consistently was the technology is mind blowing and they are not in a position to be able to engineer it yet because it's just light years beyond what we have. It's a completely new type of physics is what one person said to me, and you might be interested in this, Jay, because, up above this sort of direction that your interests have taken without expanding on it, one of the people I spoke to told me that it had a lot to do with a mind interface connection with the engineering, that it was driven by some kind of consciousness or some kind of,

01;41;20;06 - 01;41;46;27
Unknown
intelligent connection with machinery that, was beyond our understanding. Indeed, similar claims can be found within the files of the late legendary Leonard Stringfield. Analyzing string fields notes reveals a conversation with one Mr. Hines, who had a source from Bell Labs. Of course, Bell Labs. I've discussed before as having involvement in UFO legacy programs. Quote Len spoke to a mr. Hines who had a source from Bell Labs.

The informant stated that he was on the flight line at a California Air Force base in the early 1950s and saw a UFO retrieval brought in. He allegedly saw a cutaway of the recovered craft, plus the headband transceiver worn by the aliens. Anyone involved with the retrieval was subject to intense scrutiny and search. Apparently, one man must have kept a part of the craft, and he mysteriously disappeared.

01;42;10;18 - 01;42;48;18
Unknown
He was never seen again. What I can tell you is that people who work on this technology tell me it has no control systems, no control surfaces, no visible propulsion system. No dials, no levers, no buttons. It's a shell. They tell me it's operated by consciousness. Go figure. When analyzing USG special access programs focused on anomalous mental phenomena being moved into the secrecy of the corporate world, I can't help but to think of direct parallels to UFO legacy programs.

01;42;48;18 - 01;43;27;01

Acknowledged US programs into anomalous cognition began in 1977 with Project Stargate. Project Stargate was a joint secret Army DEA, CIA, and Sri international contractor program tasked to investigate the potential for military use of psychic phenomena. The program went by many codenames based on operational agencies within the program gondola, wish, Stargate Son. Street for the CIA, Grill, Flame for intercom, Center Lane for the DEA, etc. this was until 1991 when the project would consolidate under the Stargate Project and be moved to our subject of today, CIC.

01;43;27;01 - 01;43;59;01
Unknown
Stargate was initially operated out of Fort Meade, Maryland, with a key sponsor of the work being Major General Albert Stubble by, Stubble by and founded US Army Intelligence and Security Command. Intercom. Intercom initially commanded the US Special Forces Unit, the Issa Intelligence Support Activity. The Issa was later on moved to Jayhawk Joint Special Operations Command, where I and others like Chris Sharpe have accused Jason Elements of participating in foreign UFO crash retrievals alongside the CIA Office of Global Access.

01;43;59;07 - 01;44;23;04

Double blind himself has been accused by numerous individuals such as Philip J. Corso and Steven Greer as participating directly in UFO material exploitation programs at Fort Watts. UCA funding clandestine men in black type entities and much more. Stubble buying, according to Greer, is the man who offered Greer $2 billion to absorb Greer's organization, CCD, into the General's work.

01;44;23;06 - 01;44;47;06
Unknown
So it is quite intriguing. A general with keen aptitude for anomalous cognition would also be accused of participating in UFO legacy program operations. This reminds me of the quote we just heard from David Grush, but let's focus our work back to SAIC. CIC would continue Stargate from 1991 to 1994. However, I would wager this work continued long after 1994.

01;44;47;10 - 01;45;20;07

SAIC published ten primary studies focused on remote viewing and Sci phenomena. SAIC would coined the terms anomalous cognition, also known as remote viewing or clairvoyance, a form of information transfer in which all known sensorial stimuli are absent. That is, some individuals are able to gain access to information by an as yet unknown process, end quote, as well as anomalous preservation aka psychokinesis, a form of interaction with matter in which all known physical mechanisms are absent.

01;45;20;08 - 01;45;56;16
Unknown
That is, some individuals are able to influence matter by an as yet unknown process and quote. In their official reports, SAIC stated they were and earlier programs were able to verify the existence of anomalous cognition, but not able to verify the existence of anomalous perturbation. SAIC would employ agents and beacons for such experiments, agents displayed a quantitative measurement of displays of anomalous cognition and beacons served as individuals who would engage in direct sensorial stimuli from an intended target to act as a focus of attention for the anomalous cognition receiver.

01;45;56;16 - 01;46;24;17
Unknown
Some pretty incredible stuff, I know, and as I have stated before, on numerous occasions, I am still myself learning about psi phenomena in relation to the subject of UFOs. So for now we will leave SAIC working to AC and AP, but perhaps we will revisit the subject in the future. But six possible hitting continuation of Stargate does tie in to the last subject we will discuss today.

Naval support Activity Crane, home to one of the nation's most important military laboratories, is sometimes referred to as the Pentagon's best kept secret. Senator Joe Donnelly, Indiana as I mentioned at the beginning of this video, I have covered the case of Randy Anderson in the off World Technologies division. Underneath Nswc Crane before this early investigation was taken down to support Randi's testimony, reaching a wider audience on Jessie Michael's platform.

01;46;52;18 - 01;47;30;25
Unknown
With this investigation into SAIC, I thought it prudent to make my investigation into Randy Anderson available again. This is because the overwhelming majority of that investigation was labeling with High Confidence CIC as the contractor in question, in charge of a secret division, housing recovered technology. So for the full picture, I recommend watching my video to learn more about the data investigation contractors, military units, and more associated with Randy story, and to hear more from Randy overall, I highly recommend viewing Jessie's video, but let's briefly summarize Randy's experience and tie it into SAIC.

01;47;30;29 - 01;47;54;13
Unknown
In the early to mid 20 tens, Randy was sent to the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Crane, Indiana for advanced weapons training. Anderson served as a U.S. Army Green Beret 18 Bravo weapons sergeant, which meant the soldier was a highly trained expert in U.S and foreign small arms, weaponry, and explosives. Anderson and his fellow Green Berets were sent to Crane for weapons testing and training courses.

01;47;54;13 - 01;48;20;16
Unknown
However, due to holding a CIA clearance, Anderson and one other soldier were shown classified foreign and domestic weapon platforms. These included disruptive technologies such as unique Russian ballistics. But quickly, what is Crane? The Naval Surface Warfare Center, or Nswc, is part of the Naval Support Activity Crane alongside the US Army Ammunition Activity, which stockpiles much of the U.S mainland's munitions.

01;48;20;20 - 01;48;47;10
Unknown
Crane, Indiana, was chosen for the stockpile duties during World War Two. As such, a landlocked state would have proved to have been difficult to be targeted by enemy forces. Nswc Crane is a massive facility with several underground layers, highlighted as the premier Navy lab whose mission is to, quote, provide acquisition and in-service engineering and technical support for sensors, electronics, electronic warfare, and special warfare weapons.

01;48;47;10 - 01;49;17;25
Unknown
End quote operations at Crane are divided into three distinct focus areas strategic missions, electronic warfare, and expeditionary warfare. But this location doesn't focus on conventional missions. As we see from this recent Duke University long range broad agency announcement. A key focus of Crane's programs are, quote, advanced concepts and technologies, end quote, and we discuss some of these advanced concepts and technologies earlier in this project, with mention of SAIC in the GTA.

01;49;17;25 - 01;49;47;21
Unknown
The underground presence of the base is key to mention here. Not only are there numerous underground bunkers for munitions storage hidden below the ground, but also small arms testing resources such as an underground 100 meter firing range. Now, as I mentioned earlier, Randy was at Crane to test advanced foreign and domestic weaponry. The crane facility has historically worked closely with the US Army for weapons testing, training and defensive capabilities such as countering improvised explosive devices in Iraq.

01;49;47;24 - 01;50;26;11
Unknown
And the Nswc is no stranger to reverse engineering critical technology to maintain, quote unquote, fleet readiness, such as an intriguing black box I covered extensively in my first video on Randy Anderson. To the best of my knowledge, Nswc Crane is integral to naval UFO legacy programs. Previously, not only did I tie intriguing Nswc Crane contracts to work done on UFO underwater recovery programs operating out of the Navy alongside Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and U.S. intelligence agencies such as the NRO and the National Underwater Reconnaissance Office.

01;50;26;11 - 01;51;07;18
Unknown
But let's also mention that Nswc Crane likely resides in a complex system of naval centers engaged in t uo technologies of unknown origin, housing and exploitation. I know I say this all the time, but this really is another video for another day as I am still deeply engaged with this research. The thesis I am building here, however, is this Naval Undersea Warfare Center division such as key port and university affiliated research centers such as the Applied Research Laboratory at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, engage with UFO data, Naval Surface Warfare Center such as Crane, engage with T wo hardware and naval installations like China Lake and Patuxent River.

01;51;07;18 - 01;51;38;19
Unknown
Deal with quote unquote aircraft. This really will be a worthy thread. We will pull on a bit now and more in the future. That quite likely has SAIC written all over it. On 5th June 2025, Immaculate Constellation whistleblower Matthew Brown illustrated an enormously impactful tweet that directly referenced UFO materials or craft being stored at the Patuxent River Special Project hangars that are owned by the Amentum Corporation, amongst quote unquote, other fun spaces.

01;51;38;22 - 01;52;07;06
Unknown
Of course, alongside Amentum, SAIC has a significant presence at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River, enjoying similarly lucrative contracts to Nswc Crane while majorly supporting Pax River's Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division and Ship and Air Integration Warfare Division. Remember how earlier in this project we discussed joint ventures with SAIC and IG and G and SAIC and Northrop, possibly linked to UFO legacy programs?

01;52;07;06 - 01;52;39;09
Unknown
Well, SAIC has engaged in similar practices with Amentum. A contractor, Matt Brown, has now accused of housing UFO materials at Navy Air, Pax River, SAIC, and Amentum joined forces to form FSA, a contractor that as recently as 2020, has secured Idec federal contracts in excess of $1.3 billion. Perhaps in the future, we can shed more light on possible joint SAIC amentum work on UFO legacy programs at major naval stations.

01;52;39;14 - 01;53;05;00
Unknown
Anyways, after observing prosaic, disruptive technologies, Randy and one of his fellow soldiers were taken to a pristine and advanced location under Crane by an unmarked contractor in civilian clothes. Anderson was told by this guide a private contractor, former military in the same individual leading the weapons training course. Quite nonchalantly, they were entering the quote unquote, off World Technologies division.

01;53;05;06 - 01;53;28;07
Unknown
Upon entering, Randy did not enter a normal firing range or laboratory. He and the other men entered what seemed to be a scientific observation room overseeing a laboratory housing two pieces of technology staffed by one other contractor dressed similar to a lab technician. One device Randy witnessed was a sphere no bigger than a basketball that was seemingly constructed from seamless metal.

01;53;28;07 - 01;53;54;20
Unknown
The soldiers were told by their guide, this object and the other piece of technology interacted with human consciousness. The other piece of technology was seemingly similar to a type of gantlet that was, according to the contractor, considered weapon technology due to the tech producing an energetic discharge during recovery, this weapon was projecting some type of glyph writing. Randy could not distinguish between physical projection or projection into his mind.

01;53;54;27 - 01;54;19;19
Unknown
Shortly after, Randy was escorted out of the Offworld Technologies Division and to this day suffers extensive mental haze and memory problems surrounding this event. But where does SAIC tie into this? The mission of Nswc Crane is to provide the American warfighter with solutions to their toughest technical challenges to better equip a decisive advantage in electromagnetic warfare. Strategic missions.

01;54;19;19 - 01;55;10;14
Unknown
In expeditionary warfare, end quote. Crane employs a whopping 2489 contracting force and engages in projects with numerous defense contractors, DoD labs like Sandia National Labs, and universities. And also recall, as I just mentioned earlier in this project, we have already discussed mention of SAIC and many contracts for the JTA, the Joint Technology Assessment Activity, a key component of Crane that supports the Deputy undersecretary of Defense Advanced Systems and Concepts, SAIC, one of the DoD premier science and technology subject matter experts and innovative contractors, aka Washington Shadow, who has better access to the Pentagon than the government's own attorneys, has extensive contracts of interest with Nswc Crane as well as a provable previous interest in consciousness

01;55;10;14 - 01;55;35;27
Unknown
related studies similar to the sphere Randy observed that purportedly only responded to human consciousness. Indeed, right around the time of Randy's encounter, 2012, the Office of Naval Research was seemingly carrying on the legacy of SAIC and Stargate, announcing a revolutionary research study that investigated Sixth Sense among humans to understand how to train personnel, unquote, intuitive decision making, end quote.

01;55;36;04 - 01;56;13;13
Unknown
But like we've been doing in this video, let's follow the money and analyze some contracts. In my project on joint US Navy undersea UFO retrieval programs, I highlighted joint programs operating between the U.S. Navy, the Office of Naval Research, the Office of Naval Intelligence, U.S. intelligence agencies such as NRO, Nuro, and CIA, as well as USO, com or Special Operations Command, Defense contractors and DC such as the center for Naval Analyzes, miter CIC, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, and premiere U.S. naval weapons facilities such as Nswc Crane and Nswc China Lake.

01;56;13;20 - 01;56;40;16
Unknown
In that project, which I highly recommend viewing, I discussed how Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute provided submersibles for undersea UFO crash retrievals for their, quote, unique capabilities that cannot be otherwise obtained. And quote, I theorize this work was conducted through sole source Idec and Idec engineering service contracts between the National Defense Research and Development Services and Woods Hole, awarded to Naval Surface Warfare centers.

01;56;40;18 - 01;57;18;22
Unknown
Examples can be found between Woods Hole and New at Key Port for the procurement of quote hardware, materials and supplies, as well as surfaces to develop, build, fabricate, integrate, evaluate, and support the unmanned undersea vehicle family of systems for the Naval Undersea Warfare Center. And quote. Indeed, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute even has historical contracts with SAIC at Nswc Crane, such as this 24th May 2023 contract for, quote Research and Development of expeditionary systems for Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Weapon System Division jacks n end quote trains.

01;57;18;22 - 01;57;55;10
Unknown
Jay Z, aka Weapon Systems Division, falls under Nswc Crane's JCS or Special Warfare and Expeditionary Systems Division. This is the department I previously suspected and still suspect holds the Offworld Technologies Division ran by SAIC. Curiously, there is a 2020 contract of interest here that was deleted from Sykes website. This $133 million contract, awarded to SAIC, tasked the corporation to continue to provide mission engineering and integration services to the maneuver, Engagement and Surveillance Systems Division at Nswc Crane.

01;57;55;13 - 01;58;25;09
Unknown
The maneuver, Surveillance and Engagement Division, J W falls parallel to the Weapon Systems Division that sees joint contracts between SAIC, Woods Hole and Crane, both of which fall under the aforementioned Special Warfare and Expeditionary Systems Crane Division. In fact, analyzing this division brings even more intrigue nestled within the maneuver, surveillance and Engagement branch that sees enormous contracts with SAIC is a subset called JCS.

01;58;25;11 - 01;59;13;00
Unknown
But the Special Capabilities Branch are elements of the Offworld Technologies Division, hidden within Crane's Special Capabilities Branch. This 2020 $133 million contract may seem obscene, but SAIC is no stranger to, frankly, enormous contracts. Earlier in this video, we discussed hundreds of millions of dollars awarded to SAIC for IT consolidation with Sandia National Laboratories. But how about this 2023 contract that also suspiciously vanished from Sykes website around January of 2024, detailing a $249 million, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity SAIC contract to support Crane's weapons division instrumentation platform.

01;59;13;03 - 01;59;42;06
Unknown
These are but a handful of SAIC crane contracts. Numerous more absolutely enormous contracts exist, such as a 2010 $351 million contract for SAIC to provide technical engineering services to Nswc Crane in support of the Joint Special Operations Response Department, which is referencing J SoC. And remember, we've discussed today, and as I do in almost every video, I link Jayhawk elements to UFO crash retrieval.

01;59;42;08 - 02;00;15;29
Unknown
Randy claimed the contract was associated with the classified prosaic weapons training took him to the Offworld Technologies Division, where we can find even more examples of SAIC conducting weapons testing at Crane. In a now restricted article that was comically pulled after my video on Randy Anderson, SAIC demonstrated extensive technical work providing expertise to improve C4, ISR aka command control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and weapon systems for the war fighter at Nswc Crane.

02;00;16;02 - 02;00;49;11
Unknown
So if Randy story is true, is SAIC the contractor running the Offworld Technologies division? While there is no direct proof, but I would wager there is ample evidence SAIC, with their demonstrated interest in CI phenomena, engagement with assets I have accused of participating in UFO retrieval operations at Crane and proven history engaging in weapons training at Crane. Single out SAIC as operating an underground laboratory focused on the housing containment and possible exploitation of non-human technology.

02;00;49;13 - 02;01;07;01
Unknown
What's going on guys? It's UAP group, and if you made it this far with me, I'd like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for joining me into this investigation into SAIC and UFO legacy programs. Now, before I do my end of video rant, let's get a couple of things out of the way. Now, you probably see something new behind me.

02;01;07;01 - 02;01;47;06
Unknown
You probably noticed some new audio quality. I am trying as hard as I can to upgrade the studio. Get a better mic, gets better monitors, make the studio look a little nicer, make it look a little bit better than the tarp. I just got in the background, so I'll always be trying to upgrade. Anyways, as I said in the beginning of this video, I know for SAIC we don't have as many direct connections to UFO programs, specifically craft housing and RV production, than we do companies like Northrup, like we do Lockheed Martin or even some of Northrop subsidiaries, TRW, BDM, all the way back to aerospace, etc. and then FFR ADCs like miter.

02;01;47;09 - 02;02;28;08
Unknown
But I hope what I showed today is that diving through SAIC corporate history, some of their larger scandals, some of their implications and UFO programs that this company has, for lack of a better term, quite a few skeletons in its closet. Whether this be defrauding the United States government and intelligence agencies or federal forces like virtual case file with the FBI or like Project Trailblazer with the NSA, SAIC seems to have a repeating pattern of securing enormous contracts and either delivering no product under-delivering or under-delivering and asking for more money.

02;02;28;11 - 02;02;58;10
Unknown
And as we saw from quotes throughout articles published by Forbes and published by Wall Street Journal in the early 2000, there are numerous, numerous, numerous occasions on which there are anonymous or named whistleblower complaints against SAIC. And of course, we saw this with Denise McKenzie as well. And I was really interested to kind of connect Aldrich Saucier at his claims of, fraud with the SDI, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and parallel that to 1992 as well, with Denise McKenzie and SAIC.

02;02;58;12 - 02;03;21;27
Unknown
As we showed in this video, SAIC was pretty much the largest contractor for SDI for quite a few years. Larger than other companies like Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, and so forth combined. So, by extension, I think it is safe to assume that some of this fraud and waste occurring in SDI would extend to its largest by an exponential factor contractor.

02;03;21;29 - 02;03;46;04
Unknown
Now, with SAIC, probably what everybody thought going into this video was, of course, Randy Anderson, the Offworld Technologies division and Project Stargate. Now, I've said so many times, and my opinion has really changed on this matter, that some of the, for lack of a better term, psionics or psychic phenomena, plural with the UFO programs, whether that be cognitively, interfacing with a craft.

02;03;46;07 - 02;04;10;20
Unknown
In terms of course, those claims and some of these beings flying, UFOs via mind or via thoughts or headband transceivers instead of Leonard. Some of Leonard string fields notes. I have really found solace in the quote by David Crush on JRC, where David Grush talks about Stargate and remote viewing documents in the CIA reading room and other various remote viewing programs, or a C or a P.

02;04;10;20 - 02;04;33;18
Unknown
Some of those coins term terms coined by SAIC. And I really found solace in saying to Joe when Joe kind of retorts back, well, of course the CIA would be looking to gain every single leverage into intelligence gathering, whether that be a legitimate source or not, that David Grush as well maybe these some of these programs spawned out of a need to try and unlock something.

02;04;33;18 - 02;04;59;10
Unknown
We have in a warehouse somewhere. I think that is an extremely interesting quote. And then that directly kind of corresponds to the story of Randy Anderson and the Offworld Technologies division, where some of this, this sphere that he saw was claimed to interact with human consciousness and how the contractors at Nswc Crane, which is most likely and I still maintain and I still maintain even stronger, is SAIC.

02;04;59;13 - 02;05;25;01

And I also also think it's interesting, the larger SAIC connection to some of the larger Naval Air stations or naval surface warfare centers across the nation. I'm intrigued to really dive in more about, Matt Brown statements about Patuxent River and the Amentum hangars, and explore more of SAIC at Patuxent River, maybe Nswc, Dahlgren, China Lake, etc., as well as their work with Amentum.

Now looking into the corporate of SAIC, I know it's it's quite convoluted, especially when we got into the decision science applications and then that long road of DSI going into TSR, to Steven Meyers, to L-3 communications, to ingenuity, to being bought up by SAIC and L3 Harris, I know that's crazy complicated. I was really interested to find, sort of similar to triad national security with Battelle and two universities that SAIC engaged in similar practices, and this was with their RDDs, with Aegean Jeep.

Now, of course, the LLC went defunct within a couple of years. But similar to triad, this was a crack to break into D.o.e. lab work and Department of Energy classified work. But I think one of the most tangible things we have from today's video, some of the most tangible research is, of course, the SAIC whistleblowers. I do not need to say more about Doctor Sean Kirkpatrick.

I'm sure by the time this video comes out, there will be a lot of stink about the Wall Street Journal article and maybe even we'll get that part two soon. So I'd like to see more of, more of basically a hero worship tale to Sean Kirkpatrick and his great work, but I'd also like to ask if, Kona Blue was just a project tricking all Air Force personnel.

What about the circular reporting? Those two seem at odds with each other from Kirkpatrick's claims. But anyway, I digress. I do believe we stumbled upon some other high level SAIC gatekeepers, and possibly individuals that need to be subpoenaed by Congress. And of course, most of these individuals are ceased, but some are still living. These gatekeeper individuals include John M Deutch, William J.

Perry, Admiral Raybon, Admiral Owens, and Donald Kerr. I'd say of all of these individuals, Donald Kerr's CV has the greatest, greatest CV and greatest work history that would lend to UFO legacy programs. This being CIA, DSS, and DB, SAIC and row the miter Corporation, etc. I'd be real interested to hear from, more about Don Kerr's work and legacy program operations.

And gosh, I'd be really interested to speak to Okie Shannon as well. Of course, we saw in the ATP notes from 85, we see look to Don Kerr for influence and money. And earlier in those notes I didn't include this in the video. There's Don K ET with a couple other names. Now is this Don? Is this Don Kerr most likely.

02;07;55;07 - 02;08;16;02

And why it was there other information spoken about Don Kerr at this advanced theoretical Physics working group at BDM facility in McLean, Virginia, that was held one year after Double Bind joined BDM. I would certainly like to know more. And also, I know I said earlier in the video that I have found Denise McKenzie and attempted to make contact.

I've heard nothing yet. I'd really like to speak to her to learn more. I've also found Mr. Stuart Stanley and I've tried to reach out to him. Nothing yet either. So kind of the running theme with this video. And as we said in the beginning, SAIC has really seemed to stay in the shadows. Why? That is, I think they've really maintained a lower profile than companies like Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, and maintained a lower profile than even some of the other low profile guys like miter, like the CNA, like Rand, etc. so I hope if anything, this video just brings to light some of the involvement of SAIC and not only just UFO legacy

programs, but also black budget operations and some secretive work. I mean, SAIC from its inception, being staffed with high level individuals such as Bobby Ray Inman, has had numerous, numerous high level intelligence and military individuals. The way this has been explained to me in the past, as some individuals who work in UFO legacy programs within the DoD or IC, they'll trade in their stripes and stars for a pinstripe suit.

02;09;19;02 - 02;09;44;20

And essentially these guys will go from working on UFO legacy programs within official United States government and DoD avenues and intelligence avenues to doing the same thing on a corporate payroll. And you'd imagine with a lot of these gatekeepers we talked about, Sean Kirkpatrick included, a lot of these guys would either go on to work at SAIC after service in the U.S., DoD or IC, or before worked in SAIC.

This reminds me of John Deutch, who before he joined the joint US Dept Secdef and spearheaded SAP, S, R, G and SAP ork itself. He was already on the board of SAIC and already working with TRW. And how about that? I know in the Northrup video we talked quite a bit about TRW. TRW was, of course, purchased by Lockheed Martin in the early 2000, and another connection to the Wilson Davis notes TRW had also been kind of pursued, convicted and and pursued legally for overcharging on space systems, on space projects by the US DoD in the early 90s.

And in that Northrop project, I kind of, tied that together with some of the near out audits in that almost found out some of the DoD UAP legacy programs. So that's interesting as well, that so many of these individuals also have connections to TRW, of course, with TRW, have the old Zodiac story and so forth by pseudonym Sedge Masters, Richard Dolan, some done some incredible work on that.

I'd love to work with him someday, to revisit Zodiac, but I'll leave my rant there. I do hope again that this is a springboard for more research into SAIC, UFO legacy programs. I would like to hear more stories of RV and SAIC tied together, and I would like to hear more material exploitation programs and craft housing, because I going to say this in the end of my videos every time, if you are an individual who has had experience firsthand or have second hand knowledge on UFO legacy programs, this b crash retrieval or material exploitation, please email me at UAP group@protonmail.com.

I've switched away from a Gmail account. I've had some wise advice that this wouldn't necessarily be a secure method to receive such communication. So UAP, Robert Proton, Malcolm and guys, please remember to like and subscribe every like every subscription, every view, every comment helps tremendously. And like I say in every single video, I do have a Patreon. I don't gatekeeper content.

There's nothing special on there that you won't get for free here, but I say that to support the channel for what you think it's worth. But again, no content gate kept there. A lot of exciting projects coming up, maybe one interview I'm going to do that I would really, really like to do. But this just the first project in a long list of many new projects with a revitalized set up, with continued attempts to get better at recording, editing and so forth.

So we'll always put my best foot forward for you guys. Again, remember to like and subscribe! Join the Patreon if you think it's this channel's worth anything, and if you have any direct knowledge, you AP for about proton Malcolm. With that guys, I will catch everybody on the next episode and thank you so much for watching. Peace everybody.
