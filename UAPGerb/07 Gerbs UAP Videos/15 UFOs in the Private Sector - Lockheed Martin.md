{Video Clip of David Grusch on Joe Rogan}
[[David Grusch]]: "So Lockheed Martin wanted to divest itself from this material at a specific facility. That's known to me that I provided to the inspector general. Like street address, all that shit. Right? And the idea was, if they made a catcher's mitt, a security catcher's mitt for the shit, you know, most serious [[Special Access Program (SAP)|SAP]] possible, the contractor and the other government customer, which was the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], for that specific Lockheed material.

00;00;28;24 - 00;00;52;10

[[David Grusch]]: And it was shit that they recovered from, like the 50s and stuff, and it was like bits and pieces of, of of of like haul structure, shit like that. 
{Video Clip of Dr. Gary Nolan on Tucker Carlson}
Tucker Carlson: "How could not. So if an aerospace and I've heard this theory from very informed people, I don't think it's a theory. It sounds true that if there are crash materials and apparently there there are those reside in the custody of not the U.S. government, but of.."

[[Gary Nolan]]: "exactly"

Tucker Carlson: "...contractors who work for the U.S. government. Aerospace defense contractor,"

[[Gary Nolan]]: "right"


00;00;52;10 - 00;01;00;10
Tucker Carlson:  "McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed, etc.."

00;01;00;12 - 00;01;18;24
Gerb
{Video Clip of Unknown}
Unknown: "My kids actually asked the same question, and whenever I go home to business trips, I come home. They ask me, how are the aliens? Did I see the aliens? Things like that. So yeah. Do the aliens exist? That's a question for another time. But in terms of what we work on, yes, we do work on classified projects..."

Gerb
In the field of ufology.

00;01;18;24 - 00;01;43;01
Gerb
[[Lockheed Martin]], the US's biggest and most advanced aerospace and defense corporation, has been intimately woven with the study of UFOs. From reverse engineering attempts to material storage. Lockheed's name comes up again and again and again, and is specifically name dropped by credible individuals like [[David Grusch]] and [[Gary Nolan]], who we just saw. 

My friends, let's waste no time.

00;01;43;02 - 00;02;11;11
Gerb
I am your host, UAP Gerb, and join me today as we analyze [[Lockheed Martin]]'s deep history of UFOs and utilize facts and records to uncover this infamous piece of the military industrial complex's true involvement with the phenomenon. 

In 2021, late former Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] said during a New York Times interview, quote, "I was told for decades that Lockheed had some of these retrieved materials."

00;02;11;13 - 00;02;34;19
"I tried to get, as I recall, a classified approval by the Pentagon, to have me go look at the stuff they would not approve that. I don't know what all the numbers were, what kind of classification it was, but they would not give that to me."

Before we try and uncover what Senator Reid was referencing, let's review some of Lockheed's accomplishments so we understand just how advanced this company is.

00;02;34;21 - 00;03;11;23
Gerb
With annual revenues around the 60s of billions of US dollars, over half of Lockheed's annual sales go to, of course, the [[Department of Defense|DoD]] and [[D.O.E.]] and has completed feats of military engineering marvels. Such as the creation of the SR-71 Blackbird, the F-22 Raptor, the F-16, and the F-17 Nighthawk. 

Lockheed is also contributed greatly to the Space Age of Man, creating Space Shuttle propellants, designing manned maneuvering units for spacewalks, and lended key contributions to satellite creations and much, much more.

00;03;11;23 - 00;03;40;11
Gerb
And we are all deeply familiar with the famed [[Lockheed Martin|Skunkworks]] division that is intertwined with [[Department of Defense|DoD]] special access programs. Where top secret projects are conducted that result in vehicles that fly at Mach 3.2 at 100,000ft, such as the SR-71 or the production of the first stealth fighter in the F-117. 

But what about projects deeper, or in an even more classified setting than the already shadowy skunkworks?

00;03;40;14 - 00;04;03;11
Gerb
[[Lockheed Martin]] is legendary for having so much lore and whistleblowers surrounding the company's black division, but with an astonishingly thin paper trail and available evidence. 

You know me, guys, we will do whatever it takes to critically analyze and separate fact from fiction. But going into this, know that we don't have the same sort of records available to us as we did for [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]].

00;04;03;16 - 00;04;21;29
Gerb
Lockheed Martin was not working closely with [[USAF]] and [[Air Force Technology Intelligence Committee|ATIC]] to investigate UFOs, and we don't have an exact paper trail of when Lockheed got UAP material or craft. 

So we will have to do our best to analyze all of the evidence.

00;04;22;01 - 00;05;03;09
Gerb
### Lockheed Employee Claims
And we'll start by reviewing some of the perplexing claims made by actual Lockheed Martin employees and head scientists. And yes, there are multiple and quite a few to review. 

Most who are familiar with Lockheed's connection to UFOs know about [[Ben Rich]], the second Lockheed skunkworks director in the father of the F-117. Just I'm sure, as you guys know, about his famed 1993 UCLA speech where he allegedly stated, quote: 

> "we already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in black projects, and it would take an act of God to ever get them out to benefit humanity. Anything you can imagine we already know how to do."

00;05;03;11 - 00;05;28;25
Gerb
I'm not here to push any unsubstantiated claims to back my thesis, guys. So did you know there's actually no video or audio evidence of Ben saying this? 

This is not the claim. This quote is fabricated or that Rich wasn't interested in UFOs. But these quotes are recorded by author [[Linda Moulton Howe]], who is known to take some reported liberties.

00;05;29;03 - 00;05;56;20
Gerb
However, this exact quote appears to be confirmed in a 2010 MUFON article by one [[Tom Keller]]. But quite the contrary. On the 10th of July 1986, one [[John Alexander]] wrote to director Rich to expand on his statement of being a, quote, believer in UFOs. 

Andrew proposes that there are two categories of UFO and is interested to get rich his thoughts manmade and extraterrestrial vehicles.

00;05;56;23 - 00;06;21;11
Gerb
In a response letter, [[Ben Rich]] replies quote: 

> "Dear John, yes, I'm a believer in both categories. I feel everything is possible. Many of our manmade UFOs are unfunded opportunities. In both categories. There are a lot of kooks and charlatans. Be cautious. Best regards, Ben. Rich." 

Guys, please give me a congratulations for being able to decipher that cursive. It was not easy.

00;06;21;14 - 00;06;50;26
Gerb
The only discussion I can find around Rich's mentioned UCLA speech are some remarks made by MUFON director [[Jan Harzan]], who actually attended the conference and can confirm some things that Rich said. 

[[Jan Harzan]]: "He ended his talk with a slide of a black disc zipping off an outer space, and he edited it with these words. 'We now have the technology to take it home', and the entire place broke up laughing, and Tom and I just looked at each other for who did he really just say that?"

00;06;50;28 - 00;07;06;08
[[Jan Harzan]]: "And are these people really not getting that? What he's saying is real. So someone else asked the same question. So finally he just said he said, well, he said, let me ask you a question. Do you think it's possible to travel to the stars? Yes. This of a particular engineer who asked my question about his career and future, said, well, I don't know."

00;07;06;08 - 00;07;37;08
[[Jan Harzan]]: "It just take a long time to get there. He said, no, it wouldn't. We found an error in the equations and we now know how to travel to the stars." 

Gerb
So we can't really confirm or deny Rich's supposed disclosure. But we can say that he did have an interest in understanding of manmade versus non-human intelligence UFOs. 

### [[Don Phillips]]
And next we have [[Don Phillips]], who was an ex Lockheed skunkworks USAF and CIA contractor who told his story through Steven Greer's [[Greer Disclosure Project|Disclosure Project]] in 2001.

00;07;37;10 - 00;08;09;00
Gerb
And this is when Greer was still doing largely respectable work to push disclosure. 

Phillips directly claimed that Lockheed has extraterrestrial technology and, quote, "tremendous technological advances have come from their study." 

He also claimed in his interview with Greer, the US military did in fact acquire UFO craft from Roswell. Lockheed, quote, "really did put the technology to work", and Lockheed was intimately involved with [[anti-gravity research]].

00;08;09;03 - 00;08;36;00
Gerb
All of these things, Phillips claimed. But frustratingly, vetting, Phillips claimed background with skunkworks and CIA has proved to be impossible for me. 

The only mention of Phillips I can find is a paper clipping from July 29th, 1965, which confirms Phillips role in the Air Force, as well as mentions him as a graduate of Pierce College. And fun fact guys, this is the same college that we can actually factually verify.

00;08;36;00 - 00;09;01;21
Gerb
[[Bob Lazar]] went to. So analyze Phillips statements as you will. 

Personally, I view his role with Lockheed from a skeptical lens. I need verifiable proof that his role within the company was legitimate before I can judge more. However, some of the things he says about anti-gravity, Roswell, and reverse engineering UAP technology lines up almost exactly with some of the other gentlemen we're going to hear from.

00;09;01;23 - 00;09;30;12
Gerb
### [[Boyd Bushman]]
And next we move on to a controversial but very verifiable figure, [[Boyd Bushman]]. Bushman deathbed claims of working on UAP R&D for Lockheed released in 2014 and have become stuff of legend for UFO researchers. 

In this video, Boyd states that debris and materials were recovered from crash recoveries plural in New Mexico, likely [[1947 Roswell Crash|Roswell]] and maybe the [[1953 Kingman, Arizona UFO Crash|Kingman, Arizona Crash]].

00;09;30;14 - 00;10;12;07
Gerb
He comments on the company's work with [[anti-gravity]] and states his work on UAP craft concluded that these craft contain three key elements in their makeup [[Telluride]], [[germanium]], and [[palladium]]. 

Worthy to note is that these materials, Bushman suggests, comprise UAP, could be used to create a thermoelectric/photovoltaic generator with a semiconductor and capacitor as pure germanium was the first metallic material to become a superconductor in the presence of an electromagnetic field, palladium is crucial to capacitors and Telluride alloys have thermoelectric or photovoltaic properties.

00;10;12;09 - 00;10;40;15
Gerb
This isn't crucial to know you don't need to be a material scientist, but this sort of material science lends some credence to what Bushman claimed. 

Please feel free to view the whole testimony. Of course, the video will be in the description, but I want to focus on Bushman himself. 

Boyd is a verified senior specialist and top secret SCI [[Special Access Program (SAP)|SAP]] cleared employee that served in Lockheed Department 610-8, the Special Programs Division.

00;10;40;17 - 00;11;07;00
Gerb
In 1999, Bushman came under FBI investigation for suspicious foreign contact. Lockheed became concerned about the potential of Boyd sharing sensitive information with what appears to be contacts in Prague, and it's unknown if all of this contact was UAP related or not. But from our investigation, it looks like Boyd was contacting members in Prague to learn more about [[anti-gravity]].

00;11;07;02 - 00;11;36;08
Gerb
Bushman was awarded numerous patents, including, strangely, in 1997, a patent for a device that creates a magnetic monopole beam that emits pulses, levitates degauss's, stops electronics, and separates materials. 

Monopoles currently are not proven to exist in the public or physics sector, and are an incredibly interesting topic. I recommend checking out this video by PBS Spacetime if you want to learn more about magnetic monopoles.

00;11;36;10 - 00;12;01;06
Gerb
But Boyd was the real deal, right? 

Well, yeah, except for the alien bodies he showed in photographs. The tiny looking gray creature can be traced back to a toy model. 

Originally claimed by an above top secret forum thread in 2008 to be a Kmart Halloween decoration from the late 1990s. No verifiable evidence can be drawn to the toys listing.

00;12;01;06 - 00;12;31;11
Gerb
However, this is not a great look for Bushman, whether purposeful or accidental disinformation, I'm not sure, but with the presence of the two, we are faced with three options. 

That some government agency had some toy company that made models make up alien toys that appeared similar to the real aliens that resided in [[Area 51]] or [[Groom Lake]], so that if photos were ever leaked like they were with Bushman, they could leak photos of the toy as a way to discredit any whistleblower.

00;12;31;13 - 00;13;04;20
Gerb
Option two is that the photo of the model alien was given to Bushman in order to discredit him and take away from his story. 

And three, of course, Boyd purposefully pushed the photo of the toy for whatever reason. 

### [[Bernard Haisch]]
And now we arrive to the last, and probably the best and most credible speaker with regards to employment and Lockheed [[Bernard Haisch]] PhD astrophysicist, has performed astonishing work for Lockheed, including the publishing of a paper for the Lockheed Martin [[Advanced Technology Center]] with physicist [[Hal Puthoff]].

00;13;04;22 - 00;13;31;18
Gerb
The paper focused on zero-point energy of the quantum vacuum. The study, specifically looked at one or more resonant frequencies that may be associated with quantum vacuum interaction for propulsion purposes. 

I'll mention this again soon, so keep that study in mind. In 2001, [[Bernard Haisch|Haisch]] wrote an essay titled [[Black Special Access Programs]]. He had created a site called ufoskeptic.org.

00;13;31;25 - 00;13;58;23
Gerb
Don't let this site name for you. He just wanted scientists to come together to analyze UAP with a little bit more of a critical lens. 

To respect our time. I am just going to summarize this article. I'm not going to read the whole thing, but [[Bernard Haisch|Haisch]] essentially confirmed the world we came to know in 2023 with the revelations of [[David Grusch]], that these black special access programs on crash retrieval and reverse engineering can be quite independent of any given administration.

00;13;58;25 - 00;15;05;24
Gerb
And it's unrealistic to think that [[Freedom of Information Act]] requests and even presidential administrations can penetrate and read into these programs. 

That, over time, these black budget programs become extremely independent and to trace their origin instead of intelligence, they most likely fall under the office of the [[Undersecretary for Defense for Acquisition Technology and Logistics]]. 

What is even more astounding, however, are the comments [[Bernard Haisch|Haisch]] made to the public in 2018, after the existence of [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP)|AATIP]] was revealed to the American public, he said, quote: 

> "The following is conjecture. Sources tell me that this is merely the tip of the iceberg. A group of four related but separate, unacknowledged [[SCI programs]] tracing back to a [[1947 Truman Memorandum]] still exist and were housed as of the 1990s."

Guys remember the Wilson Davis memo and the reorganization of SAPs in that time. 

> "And major aerospace companies such as, for example, Lockheed, TRW, Raytheon, Aerospace Corps, etc. these would be expensive programs, since the cost of secrecy can be several times higher than research."

00;15;05;27 - 00;15;29;09
[[Bernard Haisch|Haisch]]
> "The [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP)|AATIP]] program has no relation to these. For much better funded deep black ones. Indeed, the black programs collectively have budgets in the 10 billion range and up. Topics apparently include both reverse engineering and extraterrestrial biology. The AATIP did find the UFO crash retrieval program via official channels, but was denied access to it because AATIP itself is not a [[Special Access Program (SAP)|SAP]]."

00;15;29;12 - 00;15;55;29
[[Bernard Haisch|Haisch]]
> "Senator Harry Reid petitioned the DoD to confer [[Special Access Program (SAP)|SAP]] status to AATIP, but the DoD denied his request. ""

Gerb
And lastly, guys, while not a Lockheed employee, let's take a look at USAF Master Sergeant [[Edgar Fouche]]. 

[[Edgar Fouche|Fouche]] made some astounding statements on Lockheed with some really weird evidence to back it. In 1998, the master sergeant states he temporarily worked at the [[Defense Advanced Research Center]], DARC.

00;15;56;02 - 00;16;56;09
Gerb
In 1979, which he claims is a facility beneath Groom Lake with at least ten underground stories. 

[[Edgar Fouche|Fouche]] states. He was recruited to DARC while working at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]. 

He claimed that triangular craft had been reverse engineered by UAP, contracted by none other than [[Lockheed Martin]]. 

The sergeant coined the now famous term the [[TR-3B]], which is synonymous with human made, reverse engineered triangular shaped craft and states:

> "Three prototypes have been reverse engineered by efforts at Sandia and Livermore dating back to the early 1990s, and was the first attempt at a gravity warping craft." 

What is truly wild here is we can confirm not only [[Edgar Fouche|Fouche]]'s military record, but also the fact he was actually stationed at the famed [[Area 51]].

![[Fouche DARPA Doc.png]]
Look here guys. Ed was assigned to dette three AAFTC, which is the organization at the Air Force Flight Test Center responsible for operations at Area 51, Groom Lake.

00;16;56;11 - 00;17;30;14
Gerb
But of course, Ed's line because the DARC's the Defense Advanced Research Center is not part of DARPA. Right?

Well, look, guys, a declassified study from the [[Advanced Research Project Agency]] (ARPA) shows advanced aerospace projects were performed by [[Wernher von Braun]]'s team at the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] (ABMA). 

A draft by the DoD directive shows the ABMA was considered for a transfer into a quote "Defense Advanced Research Center that would be inherently linked to JPL."

00;17;30;16 - 00;17;45;08
Gerb
It's unconfirmed if DARC was actually created, and if any advanced aerospace concepts from [[Wernher von Braun|von Braun]] made their way there. But look, guys, DARC is actually a theoretical place.

00;17;45;10 - 00;18;16;12
Gerb
### Exotic Technologies
As mentioned by [[Boyd Bushman|Bushman]], [[Bernard Haisch|Haisch]], and [[Don Phillips]], [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]] is engaged with some incredibly strange and exotic technologies that appear like they're straight out of science fiction. 

Can we confirm any of this work, like [[anti-gravity]] or strange propulsion methods? 

Well, in 1955, physicist [[Louis Witten]] states that he was recruited by one [[George Trimble]], the current VP for aviation, and Advanced Propulsion Systems at the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]].

00;18;16;15 - 00;18;58;00
Gerb
The Glenn L. Martin Company eventually evolved into [[Martin Marietta]], which merged with [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]] in '95. 

Anyways. [[Louis Witten|Witten]] states that he was recruited into the [[Research Institute for Advanced Studies]]. The RIAS Witten stated that Trimble recruited him to help develop [[anti-gravity]], and in 2013 actually stated that the team discovered techniques to harness anti-gravity in this project. 

[[Louis Witten|Witten]] suggested several ideas were tested, including utilizing an isotope of bismuth, but he does not expand on this.

Aand shocking enough, we actually have the journal evidence to prove that this research took place.

00;18;58;03 - 00;19;27;08
Gerb
And if you want to see [[Louis Witten]] talk about this, look at the link I've provided and go to about an hour 49:22. 

The anti-gravity rabbit hole runs deep, way deeper than the discussion by Bushman, Phillips and Fouche. 

I'll cover this in another time, guys, because the anti-gravity starting in about 1955 -- this research is fascinating. But remember how I mentioned in 1998 and put off published a paper on [[zero-point energy]] in the quantum vacuum?

00;19;27;10 - 00;19;51;02
Gerb
If you don't know, real fast, zero point energy is the lowest possible energy level or ground state in a quantized electromagnetic field, which interacts with a physical system of particles. 

In a quantum vacuum, vacuum must always crackle with fluctuations in the quantum field that fill it. These never ending fluctuations imbue every field with some minimum amount of energy, known as the [[zero-point energy]].

00;19;51;04 - 00;20;52;01
Gerb
Guys. You don't need to pay attention to that. Just know that this is pretty breakthrough stuff, but theoretically impossible-- [[zero-point energy]]. 

But if you looked at 2000 2017, inventor [[Salvatore Pais]] and the Naval Air Station were awarded a patent for a similar concept for a triangular shaped craft that utilized specific frequencies to interact with the quantum vacuum and generate anti-gravity capabilities. 

Sounds like UAP, right? Well, on the 22nd of August 1998, now retired Lieutenant Colonel [[Ron Blackburn]] of [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Martin Skunkworks]] and co-founder of the [[ATP Group]] at BDM international, was awarded a patent for a technology that increased aerodynamic and hydrodynamic efficiency of a vehicle in motion that includes a sketch of a disk. 

Several years later, [[Ron Blackburn|Blackburn]] states on a podcast, he reverse engineered the capabilities to eliminate sonic booms at high speeds by using videos of disc shaped craft ge had access to.

00;20;52;01 - 00;21;14;18
Gerb
Guys, think about this. This has multiple of the observables of UAP by [[Luis Elizondo|Lou Elizondo]]. The ability to operate in trans medium. Remember the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic efficiency, as well as travel at Mach speeds without the presence of a sonic boom. This sounds like UAP technology.

00;21;14;20 - 00;21;43;13
Gerb
### Lockheed/USG Paper Trail
Guys, this is a UAP Gerb video so let's analyze all the documents we can. 

Believe it or not, Lockheed has had some interesting encounters with official USG recordkeeping, such as this 1953 UFO sighting, where Lockheed test pilots and ground crew observed a flying disc with anomalous acceleration characteristics. 
![[Lockheed UAP Encounter Drawing.png]]
Three men also swore this sighting as testimony. The sighting was submitted to [[Project Blue Book|Bluebook]], but was never listed again curiously. 

00;21;43;13 - 00;22;17;20
Gerb
And guys, think back to my [[01 Wilson Davis Memo Documentary|video on the Wilson Davis memo]]  where Wilson Davis states the [[Watch Committee]] of the black UFO crash retrieval and reverse engineering program he discovered within the SAP logs told him they were almost outed due to an audit. 

Well, check this out, guys. On the 24th of July, 1986, the director of the US [[General Accounting Office]] (GAO)'s National Security and International Affairs Division, [[Frank C. Carnahan]], testified at a Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation.

00;22;17;27 - 00;22;48;07
Gerb
[[Frank C. Carnahan|Carnahan]] stated that Lockheed exhibited a poor document control system over-classified special access documents, and had zero oversight from the [[Department of Defense|DoD]] program office. 

It was then that the [[General Accounting Office|GAO]] stated the [[Defense Investigation Service]] was actually not allowed to conduct the semiannual inspects of the aerospace contract in question, and 1,460 discrepancies were found in an inventory of 40,000 documents with Lockheed.

00;22;48;09 - 00;23;24;28
Gerb
An estimated 46 documents were destroyed and 17 were transferred out of the company and were never discovered. 

Guys, this sounds extremely suspicious. The poor document control system of Lockheed and somehow missing 46 documents and a full 1,460 discrepancies. 

Well, this strangeness and Lockheed's hand in deep special access programs above even [[Department of Defense|DoD]] oversight does not end here. 

In June of 2004, former Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development [[Katherine Austin Fitts]] wrote a paper titled "The Black Budget of the United States".

00;23;25;01 - 00;23;57;08
Gerb
This paper says that, quote, "A large proportion of the nation's wealth is being illegally diverted into secret, unaccountable channels to support clandestine domestic military R&D". 

She states. She discovered evidence that Lockheed Martin Information Systems were responsible for the 'obfuscation of justice', and may have data on the siphoned DoD funds. 

Lockheed at this time was one of the subcontractors to IBM as hired by the Pentagon to manage systems that failed a [[General Accounting Office|GAO]] audit.

00;23;57;10 - 00;24;26;06
Gerb
So we have to think all of this taking place, all of Lockheed's kind of shadiness around DoD and mis tracking of funds, are they involved with the audit as I spoke about in the Wilson Davis memo?

And to add the icing on top here, guys, in 2000, commander [[Will Miller]]. Yes, the same Miller from the Wilson Davis memo told attorney [[Peter Gersten]] that senior government officials, such as a DIA director, are isolated from UAP knowledge.

Quote, "the keepers of the secrets reside in DoD middle management and civilian contractors like [[SAIC]], [[Boeing]] and [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]], and are basically the controllers who monitor the flow of money to certain classified and special access programs."

### Project Aurora/Astra
Black triangles are a legendary shape of UFOs seen for decades and are the responsible craft behind the 1989 Belgian UFO wave. Well, what if I told you that there is a paper trail of evidence that suggests this black triangle, commonly known as the [[TR-3B]], is actually a Lockheed Martin UAP reverse engineering program called [[Project Astra]] or Aurora.

00;25;14;09 - 00;25;42;03

The first mention we can find of Aurora is in the Department of Defense's fiscal year 1986 and 1987. Where 80 million was planned to be spent on an Aurora program in '86 and 2.3 billion in '87. For reference, this was more than double the cost of the B-2 spirit bomber. 

In fact, in 1997, [[John Greenwald]] of the [[Black Vault]] inquired into Aurora, but was denied any sort of access.

00;25;42;06 - 00;26;04;28

Then, in the late 1990s, we can go back to author [[Nick Cook]] of The [[Hunt for Zero Point]], who interviewed former head of Lockheed Martin Skunkworks, [[Jack Gordon]]. 

While leaving the plant in Palmdale, [[Nick Cook]] saw a large chart illustrating the lineage of every skunkworks aircraft since the XP-80 passed the Dark Star, which is the plane in the film Top Gun Maverick.

00;26;05;00 - 00;26;31;04
Gerb
There was something called Astra, an ultra high speed reconnaissance craft that looked triangular in shape, and it looked similar to some of the triangle seen in Belgium in the early 90s. 

And when cook asked, Gordon was flustered and denied Astra was anything but an old airliner. And while we're here, let's not forget about the triangle shaped craft. Fouche claimed Lockheed possession was actively reverse engineering at [[DARC]].

00;26;31;07 - 00;27;04;21
Gerb
And do you guys remember the release of the [[Calvin UFO photo]] in 2022 2023, which was taken in Scotland and depicts a large triangle diamond shaped UFO that was referenced by the British Ministry of Defense? 

Well, if you look closely at former [[Project Condon]], that was the Ministry of Defense's official UFO investigation program. The [[Calvin UFO photo]] is listed as Astra/Aurora photos, among other 35 millimeter slides that don't appear on this last file.

00;27;04;28 - 00;27;55;00
Gerb
This could be very significant, as in this same MOD Condon report, the Brits were interested in investigating UAP sourced from USG contractor projects, and this Aurora/Astra may be listed here. 

Was even more interesting to note. This [[Condon Report]] took special interest of triangle sightings, as seen here in the executive summary page of the report. 
![[Condon Triangle Shape.png]]
And it appears the British had taken a keen interest in Aurora or Astra as a USG UAP triangle craft reverse engineered because back in the 22nd of December 1992, the British Embassy in Washington, DC wrote to Assistant Chief of Air Staff in London regarding the USGS reaction to triangular UAP sightings, specifically a sighting that occurred three years earlier by a British Royal Observer Corps member. 

00;27;55;00 - 00;28;19;03
Gerb
This investigation into USAF caused, quote, considerable irritation by the Brits. And the British officials who monitored the USG reaction are quoted as saying: 

> "Secretary of the Air Force [[Donald B. Rice]] was, to say the least, incensed by the renewed speculation that he had lied to Congress by stating that Aurora did not exist."

00;28;19;06 - 00;28;39;11
Gerb
So as we can see guys, a lot more work needs to be done investigating Aurora/Astra, but these strings connect triangular shaped craft to both Lockheed Martin and [[USAF]], and that the [[British MoD]] had a keen interest in finding out what the heck these things were. 

### Outro
What's up guys? I hope you enjoyed this look into [[Lockheed Martin]] and UAPs.

00;28;39;13 - 00;29;22;06
Gerb
As you can see after watching this video, there are a ton of public figures who make pretty bold claims about Lockheed. 

And while these claims are most likely true, as confirmed by Grusch and other key people, it's really hard to actually get to the bottom of this.

If you see, our paper trail is not exceedingly long, we have [[Lockheed Martin]] interacting with [[Project Blue Book|Bluebook]] in the 50s, and we have our audit trail that, you know, very likely is involved with the audit mentioned in the [[Wilson Davis Memo]] that the watch committee had to basically reorganize SOP status in the 90s to hide themselves better.

00;29;22;08 - 00;29;43;17
Gerb
But what do you guys think is is Lockheed as much of a player in the reverse engineering and material exploitation of UAP as [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]]? I personally think so. Yes, but they are just a lot harder to track down. 

As our nation's largest defense contractor, I imagine they have some pretty darn good record systems to keep stuff like this out.

00;29;43;20 - 00;30;12;21
Gerb
What did you guys think of the witnesses? I'd say order of most credible to least credible. We got [[Bernard Haisch]], [[Boyd Bushman]] and [[Don Phillips]].

Don Phillips. It's unfortunate. I can't verify his background, so it's really hard for me to take his word as gospel. Boyd Bushman, a really interesting witness, says some interesting things, but the toy alien I... more analysis needs to be done there, but quite frankly, I'm not sure where to go from there.

00;30;12;23 - 00;30;37;12
Gerb
But in addition, the Aurora/Astra could be its own hour long documentary. But I just wanted to do a summary, an overview of of what's going on, because there's a lot more to Aurora/Astra, including aerospace. Illustrator [[Mark McCandlish]] seen, something called the TR-3B or the triangular shaped craft and Lockheed Martin while leaving a facility and so forth.

00;30;37;12 - 00;30;59;01
Gerb
So there's a lot more to dive into, guys. Maybe I'll do that someday, but I need a little bit more information on Aurora/Astra. Some concrete information to make another video, because this video is a lot of speculation for for what I like. Pushing the boundaries of speculation versus fact, but this was an exhausting list of facts and data to make.
