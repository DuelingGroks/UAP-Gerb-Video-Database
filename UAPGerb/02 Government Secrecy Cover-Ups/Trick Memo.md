# **The Trick Memo ‚Äì Pre-Determined UFO Debunking**

## **üìå Overview**

The **Trick Memo** is a **1966 internal memorandum** written by **[[Robert J. Low]]**, the **second-in-command of the Condon Committee**, which was tasked with evaluating UFO phenomena. The document was **leaked in 1967** by Dr.[[James E. McDonald]] and **revealed that the study was designed to discredit UFOs from the start**. This revelation **discredited the objectivity of the Condon Committee** and exposed a **pre-determined bias** against serious UFO research.

## **üìù Contents of the Memo**

Low‚Äôs memo, written to two University of Colorado administrators, outlined **how to ensure the study would appear objective to the public** while signaling to the scientific community that the committee had **"almost zero expectation" of finding anything of value**. Key excerpts include:

> _"The trick would be, I think, to describe the project so that to the public it would appear a totally objective study. But to the scientific community, it would present the image of a group of nonbelievers trying their best to be objective but having an almost zero expectation of finding a saucer."_

> _"One way to do this would be to stress investigation, not of the physical phenomena, but rather of the people who do the observing... The psychology and sociology of persons and groups who report seeing UFOs."_

This strategy **shifted the focus away from actual UFO reports** and onto the **credibility of witnesses**, ensuring that any unexplained cases would be dismissed as **misinterpretations, hoaxes, or psychological phenomena**.

- **Broke Trust in the [[Condon Committee]]**:
    
    - The memo revealed that the committee‚Äôs conclusion was **pre-determined** before investigations even began.
    - It **undermined public and Congressional trust** in the study.
- **Dr. [[James E. McDonald]]'s Exposure**:
    
    - The memo was leaked by **Dr. James E. McDonald**, a physicist who strongly criticized the committee‚Äôs bias.
    - He described the Condon study as **a scientific fraud**, pointing out that **30% of cases remained unexplained** yet were dismissed.
- **[[J. Allen Hynek]]‚Äôs Criticism**:
    
    - Hynek, initially a consultant for the Air Force‚Äôs UFO programs, later called the Trick Memo proof that **the government wanted UFO research shut down**.
- **Condon Committee‚Äôs Legacy**:
    
    - Despite the controversy, the **[[National Academy of Sciences]] endorsed the Condon Report**, leading to the **shutdown of [[Project Blue Book]] in 1969**.
    - This established the **"official" narrative that UFOs were not worth studying**, despite military and intelligence agencies secretly continuing their interest.
