### 📌 Overview

In **“Incredible UFO Footage – FLYBY,”** UAP Gerb analyzes a mysterious clip dating back to **2008** that shows what appears to be a **saucer-shaped UFO** flying extremely close to the **wing of an F/A-18 Super Hornet** (or similar military jet). The video is notoriously **low-resolution** yet exhibits flight characteristics (e.g., no visible propulsion, abrupt acceleration) that align with Lue Elizondo’s recognized UAP traits.

Gerb delves into:

1. **Possible Authenticity**: Is this a “real deal” cockpit capture, or is it CGI?
2. **Audio Analysis**: Ambiguous cockpit sounds and voice murmurs in the background.
3. **Craft Shape & Historical Similarities**: Comparisons with classic **saucer** sightings and older photographs.
4. **Alleged Classified Document**: A rumored “UAP Task Force” comms log referencing a fighter intercept scenario eerily matching this footage.

### 🔍 Key Discussion Points

8. **Authenticity Debate**
    
    - The clip shows a classic disc shape with minimal pixel clarity. Could be a real cockpit leak or a skillful CGI/hoax.
    - Reflection elements in the footage suggest it’s filmed from **inside a cockpit** or from a carefully staged environment.
9. **Audio Forensics**
    
    - **Ambiguous chatter** in the background. A Reddit user tried isolating voices, finding a possible **female** voice.
    - Potential mismatch between what we see on screen and the audio track—could be layered from another source.
10. **Comparable UFO Encounters**
    
    - Lue Elizondo and Christopher Mellon have publicly stated some classified videos show UFOs within **50 ft of cockpits**.
    - The UFO in question resembles classic sightings: **McMinnville photos**, **Bob Lazar’s “sport model,”** etc.
11. **Leaked UAPTF Report**
    
    - Purported “Appendix F, Section 4B” logs mention a close-range intercept, consistent with the imagery in the video.
    - The same document references 1,292 UFO cases, possible **autonomous or mechanical life forms,** and “behavioral data analysis.”
12. **Rabbit Holes & Speculation**
    
    - If the leak is genuine, it suggests a **high-value** or “legacy” UFO video studied within the UAP Task Force.
    - Alternatively, it may be an elaborate hoax, given the complexity and detailed pilot jargon.

### Intro
On May 14th, 2008. A perplexing and enigmatic 20 second clip supposedly depicting a disc shaped UFO moving alongside a jet, appeared out of the blue on YouTube. 

This video was uploaded by a long dead channel titled [[Danny Lampkin]] in the video description. Lampkin says one simple sentence quote:

> "Am not too sure about this one, but I thought I would download it anyway for you to decide."

00;00;51;02 - 00;01;16;03
Gerb
Okay, I can probably guess what you're thinking right now. This video is far too fantastic to be true. The quality is garbage. This is bad CGI. Or just a model on a string. But this footage is far more complex and scintillating than initially meets the eye. 

Let's dive in and try to determine the authenticity of the [[Flyby UFO footage]].


00;01;16;05 - 00;01;40;11
Gerb
Guys, welcome back to the channel. I'm your host, UAP group. Let's dive right into this today, because I want to dissect one of my favorite pieces of UFO footage that has kept me pondering for the better part of a decade: The flyby footage. 

If this footage is the real deal, it is the best example of a closely filmed UFO encounter in the entire public realm.

### Context
00;01;40;13 - 00;02;04;27
Gerb
Former [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP)|AATIP]] director [[Luis Elizondo|Lou Elizondo]] once stated there is UFO footage leaked to the public realm that he was shocked had not broken Global News. 

We can only assume this footage has been seen, but labeled fake or skipped over by the UFO community and internet at large. 

During an interview with GQ in 2021, when asked about the [[Gimbal]], [[Go Fast]], and [[UFO Pentagon videos]].

00;02;04;29 - 00;02;27;00
Gerb
Lue stated that these three videos were some of the least compelling out there. And that quote, 

> "there's videos out there in government that the public haven't seen yet. There's one that's 23 minutes long. There's another one where this thing is 50ft away from the cockpit. I mean, it ain't ours. We know that, sometimes, you just couldn't believe it."

00;02;27;03 - 00;02;54;06

[[Luis Elizondo]]: "We're 99% sure it's not for adversarial technology. So that only leaves really one. One other option. It's someone or somethings else. 

Researcher: "Are these three videos the only videos that you know of that the United States government has? It shows unidentified aerial phenomena. 

[[Luis Elizondo]]: "No. Absolutely not. These are probably some of the least compelling videos. Some cases, you know, we've seen these things 50ft away from the cockpit." 

On a Joe Rogan Experience appearance.

00;02;54;06 - 00;03;27;23
Gerb
[[Christopher Mellon]], the former deputy assistant secretary of defense staff director of the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated he had seen footage of a UAP right next to a pilot. 

I'm not sure if this is the same footage Lou is referencing, but I am 100% positive the footage Mellen was referring to is not the flyby footage, but we are now faced with the mind melting fact: there are real instances of UFOs traveling within 15m of aircraft.

00;03;27;23 - 00;03;49;17
Gerb
So let's start to break down this clip. I can only trace this case back to around April of 2008, where it was posted on the UFO chronicles.com titled quote "Flying saucer (UFO) Filmed From Jet Window?" 
 
The video then began popping up onto YouTube around May 2008. Unfortunately, I cannot find any record of this clip before April of '08.

00;03;49;19 - 00;03;56;16
Gerb
So this is where our trail starts.

00;03;56;19 - 00;04;21;19
Gerb
### The Footage
At a brief glance, we can see this video is certainly under 240p, but what we are actually looking at is a recording of a screen meaning someone recorded the original footage plane on a computer screen. So this is a second generation recording. 

If we look closely, we can see the reflection of equipment. One possibility is the reflection of the camera utilized to record the camera screen.

00;04;21;21 - 00;04;43;12
Gerb
More likely, however, these are reflections of possible objects within the plane's cockpit reflecting against the glass. This would likely be a camcorder positioned inside the cockpit, with possible additional reflective catches of a Gentex MBU-23P pilot respirator mask.

00;04;43;14 - 00;05;09;28
Gerb
Following these possibilities, we must now consider. This footage is taken from inside a military jet and not commercial airliner. 

Well, one such craft exists that has an interior mounted camera. The NASA F-18 variant, the NASA chase F-18a as seen here. The jet has a mounted camcorder behind the pilot's seat, able to film starboard or portside without obstruction.
![[NASA Chase F-18a Interior.png]]

00;05;10;00 - 00;05;31;11
Gerb
In our video, we see what looks to be a jet wing filmed portside with empty missile wingtip pylons. Take a look at this cockpit view of an F-18 Super Hornet. The wing angle matches and so do the wing tip pylons.

00;05;31;14 - 00;06;01;26
Gerb
### The Sound
Okay, what about the audio of this footage? We can hear a loud, muffled noise and possibly human voices within the video. 

I see two possibilities here. One, the footage features original sound recorded from the pilot, played back on a device and rerecorded from the secondary camera, recording  the computer screen. The audio could be pure or combined with ambient background noise from the computer recording, or two ambient sounds from the screen recording location.

00;06;01;28 - 00;06;25;17
Gerb
Speculating on possibility to the audio sounds extremely similar to the 2019 U.S. Navy filmed spherical shaped UFO object going into water. Posted by [[Jeremy Corbell]] Featuring ambient sounds from the USS Nimitz. Check out this comparison.

{Audio Comparison}

00;06;50;25 - 00;07;09;05
Gerb
To think about possibility, one hears the ambient noise inside the cockpit of an F-18 Super Hornet. And our footage.

{Audio Comparison}

00;07;09;08 - 00;07;29;23
Gerb
As one Reddit user pointed out, the audio waveform does not cut at second for of our video where there is a footage cut, leading credence to the possibility that whatever we hear is, in fact ambient noise of a ship where the screen recording was captured. 

Lastly, audio wise, you might be able to hear faint voices in the background.

00;07;29;26 - 00;07;54;27
Gerb
This same Reddit user attempted to isolate the voices, and here is what they came up with.

{Audio Comparison}

00;07;55;00 - 00;08;07;02
Gerb
I cannot even begin to guess what is being said. However, this does appear to be a female voice.

00;08;07;04 - 00;08;33;29
Gerb
### The Craft
Quickly, I wanted to brush over the craft depicted in this video. This UFO is almost identical to the saucer shaped craft as described by [[Robert Jacobs|Lieutenant Jacobs]] in his warhead shootdown footage. 

This craft also appears to be extremely similar to some of the most famous UFO photographs ever taken. The [[1950 McMinnville UFO photographs|McMinnville photos]] notice the protrusion on top of the craft, which, as described by Jacobs, is similar to half of a ping pong ball.

00;08;34;02 - 00;09;02;29
Gerb
This same upper protrusion is also seen in the McMinnville images. The craft here also flies at an angle, something seen in numerous saucer images and descriptions of saucer encounters. Controversial as he is, even [[Bob Lazar]] claimed the disc shaped craft fly quote belly towards their destination.

00;09;03;02 - 00;09;33;01
Gerb
### The Document
Oh boy, here we go. Lastly, I want to talk about the most enigmatic connection to this case in 2021 or '22, an alleged leaked classified military communications log made its way around the internet, including a post on the ever famous [[4-Chan]]. 

Now, everything from [[4-Chan]] must be taken with a grain of salt, but these leaked comms are purportedly a page of a longer classified version of a UAP task force report prepared for Congress.

00;09;33;03 - 00;09;58;21
Gerb
Let's break down this comms log. 

The log details the cockpit voice recording of a fighter aircraft club 1-1 during an interception directed by [[AWACS]] Airborne Warning and Control System callsign Brigham, which serves as a flying long range radar and command center that provides tactical commands services to units in their network. Think of eyes in the Sky for fighter units.

00;09;58;24 - 00;10;23;13
Gerb
And lastly [[BLK]]. Unclear what this is. They do not identify themselves, but they use NATO brevity language. 
The fighter is crewed by a pilot, PC and weapon system operator WSO sitting in the back and managing some systems. Think back to the NASA chase F-18a The dual seater. [[BLK]] is guiding them to intercept a bogey seen on radar.

00;10;23;15 - 00;10;46;09
Gerb
The fighter can't see this bogie initially, but at some point the WSO catches it in his radar and tells the pilot it's coming at them. At 2,820 knots. 

Electronic countermeasures are activated and the crew is alerted that a missile has been launched at them, or that they are being actively tracked by radar. This could have been done manually or automatic.

00;10;46;11 - 00;11;09;03
Gerb
The bogey gets so close that from [[BLK]]'s point of view, both contacts quote merge meaning they are overlapping at the current resolution and the fighters crew have had no visual contact yet. 

They declared the target as quote "bogey dope". When the crew confirms that they see nothing, they ask for further instructions from [[BLK]], who tells them to standby.

00;11;09;06 - 00;11;37;27
Gerb
The crew then see an object on the starboard wing quote, hanging out about 10 to 15ft from the canopy. 

The pilot is shocked, however, [[BLK]] tells them not to change velocity or vector. [[BLK]] tells the crew to quote, open your blue envelopes and snooze. Essentially telling the crew to confirm their weapons are off and then to open an envelope and proceed with briefed mission control procedures, which may include radio silence or channel changes.

00;11;38;00 - 00;12;01;25
Gerb
The described events in this comms log line up almost exactly, with the bogies seen off the starboard wing of our FA-18 in our video, does it not? 

But is this document real and does it describe our flyby sighting? Our footages connection to this comms log starts to dive into a deep rabbit hole. And stay with me here.

00;12;01;27 - 00;12;30;13
Gerb
If this is indeed an online LARP, it was constructed by someone who is very familiar with pilot lingo. As we talked about, this page is purportedly a leaked page from an appendix of the longer classified version of the [[UAP Task Force]] report. Look at the top of this page. Appendix F4B.13 from page 508. 

Well, there is another alleged page from this leaked document.

00;12;30;15 - 00;13;03;10
Gerb
Section five Behavioral Data Analysis. Details 1,292 UFO cases by the joint elements of ONI, NSA, DHS and SAP cleared experts by the [[Department of Defense|DoD]]. 

What is absolutely insane about this document are the conclusions presented on this page that some [[UA/SP]], unidentified aerial/submerged phenomena. 

This, in my opinion, gives little credence to the document giving the distinction between aerial and submerge, but anyways.

00;13;03;10 - 00;13;38;18
Gerb
That these conclusions result that UAP are either remote or autonomous  drones or a form of mechanical life. 

This document asserts that an "organic species" has been deploying [[UA/SP]] that have seen a rapid increase in flight performance, indicating a quote "stepped virtual evolution process". 

According to one mentions Shiba Koya, gradual changes in the UA/SP appearance and behavior highlight generational changes.

00;13;38;20 - 00;14;06;16
Gerb
I have done an exhausting search into the names mentioned on this page. [[M. Harmen]], [[S. McCarren]] and [[K. Shibakoya]] and the quote "[[Blackout Flower Report]]" and quote "[[Layer 3 Behavioral Assessment]]". But I have found almost nothing. 

We have to assume these are pseudonyms used or first names of these people removed entirely. My only luck has been able to find one.

00;14;06;16 - 00;14;42;03
Gerb
Hillary S McCarron, whose LinkedIn page features her as a research neuroscientist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense. 

As a neuroscientist, her hand featured on a page allegedly studying UFO behavior fits. I'll be doing more investigation here. But, guys, if I am disappeared, you know why? 

At the bottom of the page featuring the names and reports, look at appendix F, section 4b titled D.O.D. (1992 -2017) High value witness interviews.

![[4-Chan Leaked Flyby Doc Screengrab.png]]

00;14;42;03 - 00;15;11;25
Gerb
Real or faked. Our comms log is featured in this section five Behavioral Data Analysis. These are both featured in the same allegedly leaked document. 

The latest contribution to this report was from [[K. Shibakoya]] in 2020, and during this time, the UAP Task Force was still running 2017 to '22. So possibly this is an internal report from the [[UAP Task Force]].

00;15;11;27 - 00;15;40;21
Gerb
Could this alleged report be true and subsequent appendix, comm log detail or flyby footage as a, quote, "high value witness testimony"? 

If so, that makes our flyby footage one of the most crucial pieces of UFO footage ever taken. 

But still, this footage remains so anomalous. 

### Outro
What's up guys? It's UAP Gerb. Thank you for joining me today. Look, I'm sorry, I'm a little bit disheveled.

00;15;40;23 - 00;15;57;20
Gerb
I just got back from training, but I wanted to wrap this video up and see what you guys think about this fly by case. I wanted to take a quick break from some of our more documentary style fact analysis and do a little speculation, but, you know, with me, we don't just speculate. We try to break everything down.

00;15;57;22 - 00;16;21;17
Gerb
Unfortunately, I'm not a CGI expert. I have no experience. And, any sort of CGI or much kind of in-depth video editing. So if you do and you can perform an analysis on this fly by footage, try to determine if, in fact, this video has some sort of CGI, some clipping, some differential frame rate between the object and the ambient picture.

00;16;21;19 - 00;16;38;17
Gerb
Get in contact with me at uapgerb@gmail.com and let me know. And maybe you and I can make a part two to this case and crisp it up. Because as it stands right now, this case is incredibly anomalous. And as you've seen, there's a pretty wild rabbit hole behind this case, especially with the supposed UAPTF leaked documents.

00;16;38;18 - 00;16;57;16
Gerb
So let me know what you think about this case. I know the footage seems a little too good to be true, but at the end of the day, we don't know if it is very well. Could be. 

So thank you for joining me. Remember to like and subscribe. Let me know what you thought and I will catch you guys next time.
