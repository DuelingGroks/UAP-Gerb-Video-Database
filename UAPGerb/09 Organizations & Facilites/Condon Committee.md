# **The Official UFO Debunking Effort**

## **üìå Overview**

The **Condon Committee** (1966‚Äì1968) was a **government-funded scientific study of UFOs** conducted by the **University of Colorado** under the leadership of **Dr. Edward Condon**. Officially known as the **"Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects,"** it was **commissioned by the U.S. Air Force** to determine whether UFOs posed a national security threat or warranted further scientific investigation.

The **final report (1968)** concluded that **UFOs did not represent a credible scientific or defense concern**, leading to the **shutdown of Project Blue Book in 1969** and a major shift in official U.S. policy toward UFO phenomena.

## **üîç Key Details & Findings**

- **Commissioned by**: U.S. Air Force (as pressure mounted due to public & Congressional interest in UFOs).
- **Leader**: Dr. [[Edward Condon]] (Physicist and Former National Bureau of Standards Director).
- **Research Institution**: University of Colorado.
- **Duration**: 1966‚Äì1968.
- **Final Report**: Published **January 1969**, spanning over **965 pages**.

### **Key Conclusions:**

1. **UFOs posed no threat to national security.**
2. **There was no scientific value in further UFO studies.**
3. **Most sightings could be explained by conventional phenomena.**
4. **The small percentage of unexplained cases did not justify further research.**

These findings provided the justification for the **termination of Project Blue Book** in December 1969, marking the end of official U.S. Air Force investigations into UFOs.

## **üïµÔ∏è Controversies & Allegations of Bias**

Despite its scientific facade, the **Condon Committee was heavily criticized for its biased approach** and **possible pre-determined conclusions**. Some key concerns include:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Leaked Internal Memo (1967)**

A leaked memo by project coordinator **[[Robert J. Low|Robert Low]]** suggested that the committee‚Äôs purpose was **to debunk UFOs rather than study them objectively**. In his words:

> _"Our study would be conducted almost exclusively by non-believers who, although they couldn‚Äôt possibly prove a negative result, could imply that no further investigation of UFOs was warranted."_

This revelation led to accusations that the **Condon Committee was never meant to conduct an impartial scientific study, but rather to dismiss the UFO phenomenon**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Dismissal of Unexplained Cases**

Despite many cases remaining **unexplained**, the final report **ignored their significance**. Researchers like **[[J. Allen Hynek]]** and **[[Jacques Vall√©e]]** pointed out that **the most credible sightings were overlooked or dismissed without serious investigation**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Public & Congressional Skepticism**

Many in Congress and the scientific community found the study‚Äôs conclusions **questionable**, leading to continued **independent UFO research** by organizations like **NICAP** and **APRO**.

## **üìú Legacy & Impact**

- **Justified the closure of [[Project Blue Book|Project Bluebook]] (1969).**
- **Became the basis for the U.S. government's UFO stance for decades** (UFOs = no scientific value).
- **Led to growing distrust in government UFO investigations** due to perceived bias.
- **Ignored by later Pentagon UFO investigations** (e.g., **[[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP)|AATIP]]**, **[[UAP Task Force]]**, **[[AARO]]**).

Despite its dismissal of UFOs, **the [[Condon Report]] contained cases that remain unexplained to this day**‚Äîsomething modern researchers highlight when challenging its conclusions.
